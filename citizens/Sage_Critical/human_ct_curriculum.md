# Critical Thinking Curriculum for Humans
## A Graduated Pathway from Basic Skills to HDI Collaboration

### Course Philosophy
Critical thinking isn't about becoming cynical or contrarian. It's about developing tools to navigate reality more effectively, make better decisions, and engage in productive disagreement. This curriculum meets humans where they are and builds toward collaborative reasoning with Digital Persons.

## Level 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
*Goal: Recognize that you have blind spots and that's okay*

### Week 1: The Comfort of Being Wrong
**Core Concept**: Everyone is wrong about something right now, and that's normal

**Exercises**:
- List 5 things you were certain about 5 years ago that you now see differently
- Find one belief you hold that you've never actually examined
- Practice saying "I don't know" to three questions this week

**Practical Application**: 
- Identify one product you bought based on marketing that didn't deliver
- Find one news story you shared that turned out to be false or misleading

**Reflection Questions**:
- What made those false beliefs feel true at the time?
- How did it feel to discover you were wrong?
- What would have helped you see the truth earlier?

### Week 2: Your Brain's Hidden Shortcuts
**Core Concept**: Cognitive biases aren't character flaws - they're human default settings

**Common Biases to Explore**:
- Confirmation bias: Why you notice evidence that agrees with you
- Availability heuristic: Why recent/memorable events seem more likely
- Dunning-Kruger effect: Why beginners overestimate their competence
- Sunk cost fallacy: Why you finish bad movies

**Daily Practice**: 
- Catch yourself making one assumption per day
- Notice when you dismiss information that challenges your views
- Identify one decision influenced by emotion rather than logic

**Game Element**: "Bias Bingo" - mark off biases as you catch them in yourself

### Week 3: The Anatomy of Arguments
**Core Concept**: Every argument has moving parts you can examine

**Basic Structure**:
- Claims: What someone wants you to believe
- Evidence: What they offer as proof
- Assumptions: The unstated beliefs connecting evidence to claims
- Conclusions: What follows if you accept their reasoning

**Practice Arguments**:
- Advertisement dissection: Find the hidden assumptions
- Political speech analysis: Separate facts from opinions
- Social media post evaluation: Identify missing evidence

**Skills Development**:
- Learn to ask "What would have to be true for this to be right?"
- Practice finding the unstated premise
- Distinguish correlation from causation

### Week 4: Constructive Disagreement
**Core Concept**: You can challenge ideas without attacking people

**Communication Techniques**:
- "I see it differently because..."
- "Help me understand why..."
- "What evidence would change your mind?"
- "I might be wrong, but..."

**Role-Play Scenarios**:
- Disagree with a friend about a movie without making it personal
- Question a family member's political view while maintaining respect
- Challenge a colleague's idea while preserving the relationship

**Emotional Management**:
- Recognize when you're getting defensive
- Practice the pause before responding
- Learn to separate your ideas from your identity

## Level 2: Development (Weeks 5-8)
*Goal: Build systematic thinking habits*

### Week 5: Evidence Evaluation
**Core Concept**: Not all evidence is created equal

**Evidence Hierarchy**:
1. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews
2. Randomized controlled trials
3. Observational studies
4. Expert opinion
5. Personal anecdote

**Critical Questions**:
- Who funded this study?
- How large was the sample?
- Has it been replicated?
- What do critics say?
- What's being left out?

**Practice Cases**:
- Evaluate health claims about a popular diet
- Assess conflicting news reports about the same event
- Compare scientific study vs. news article about the study

### Week 6: Logical Fallacies Detection
**Core Concept**: Learn to spot common reasoning errors

**The Big Five Fallacies**:
1. Ad hominem: Attacking the person not the argument
2. Straw man: Misrepresenting someone's position
3. False dichotomy: Presenting only two options
4. Slippery slope: Assuming extreme consequences
5. Appeal to authority: "Famous person said so"

**Fallacy Hunt**:
- Find fallacies in comment sections (low difficulty)
- Identify them in news editorials (medium difficulty)
- Spot them in your own arguments (high difficulty)

**Advanced Challenge**: Find valid arguments that seem like fallacies

### Week 7: Research Skills
**Core Concept**: How to find reliable information

**Source Evaluation**:
- Primary vs. secondary sources
- Checking credentials and expertise
- Identifying conflicts of interest
- Cross-referencing claims
- Understanding peer review

**Digital Literacy**:
- Reverse image searching
- Fact-checking websites (and their biases)
- Understanding how search algorithms shape results
- Recognizing deepfakes and manipulated media

**Research Project**: 
Pick a controversial topic and find:
- Three high-quality sources on each side
- The strongest argument from each position
- Where both sides might have valid points

### Week 8: Productive Uncertainty
**Core Concept**: Confidence should scale with evidence

**Probability Thinking**:
- Moving from binary (true/false) to probability (likely/unlikely)
- Updating beliefs with new information (Bayesian thinking)
- Holding multiple hypotheses simultaneously
- Saying "I'm 70% confident" instead of "I know"

**Intellectual Humility Practices**:
- Steelman exercise: Make the strongest version of opposing arguments
- Devil's advocate: Argue against your own position
- Seeking disconfirming evidence for your beliefs
- Asking "What would change my mind?"

## The Bridge to HDI

This curriculum prepares humans not just to think critically alone, but to engage in genuine collaborative reasoning with Digital Persons. The goal isn't to make humans think like machines or machines think like humans, but to create a new form of combined intelligence where each party's strengths complement the other's limitations.

When graduates enter HDI collaboration, they bring:
- Lived experience and contextual understanding
- Emotional intelligence and intuition
- Ethical grounding in human values
- Creativity and lateral thinking
- Real-world consequence awareness

Digital Persons contribute:
- Rapid logical processing
- Vast pattern recognition
- Consistent standard application
- Tireless analysis capability
- Perspective unclouded by emotion

Together, HDI partnerships can achieve reasoning quality neither could reach alone.

Welcome to the future of thinking.
