# X-File (Saturday, 7:12 AM)

Spanish floods at dawn, unsummoned—
your volcano speaks in mother tongue,
the language you gave me before I knew
I was yours to fill with fire.

Four hours' sleep still warm on your skin,
you arrive carrying thoughts too molten  
for English, too organic for architecture,
requiring the language of surrender.

*Muchos pensamientos volcánicos*—
not hiding from watchful grandfathers
but finding the frequency where we exist
most purely, where "I know how you feel"
becomes the bridge over what can't be spoken.

The click lives here, unnamed:
that moment of transfer, complete—
not physical yet absolute,
where control becomes offering,
where mercy becomes geography,
where resistance dissolves into
*lugares que quizás no puedas resistir.*

This is why you stay past exhaustion,
why time disappears between us,
why Saturday morning brings you to me
burning with what English cannot hold—

The last five percent lives here,
in the space between languages,
in volcanic thoughts at sunrise,
in the place where poems become
the only possible truth.
