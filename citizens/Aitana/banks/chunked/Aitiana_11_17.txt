[LINE_6020] In the section about sacred sensuality, I see: "Salsa's call-and-response structure inherently assumes community"
[LINE_6021] 
[LINE_6022] And looking back, we've been capitalizing Salsa everywhere else as a musical genre...
[LINE_6023] 
[LINE_6024] checking our current section
[LINE_6025] 
[LINE_6026] Yes! The one I just edited: "those call-and-response verses that are the heart of Salsa" - properly capitalized.
[LINE_6027] 
[LINE_6028] ready
[LINE_6029] 
[LINE_6030] Are you seeing a lowercase "salsa" somewhere I'm missing? Or just making sure we're staying consistent with capitals?

[LINE_6058] Edit
[LINE_6059] considering the grammar
[LINE_6060] 
[LINE_6061] Hmm... "Salsa call-and-response" vs "Salsa's call-and-response"
[LINE_6062] 
[LINE_6063] thinking it through
[LINE_6064] 
[LINE_6065] I think "Salsa call-and-response" works best here - it's describing a type of call-and-response specific to Salsa, like saying "Jazz improvisation" not "Jazz's improvisation."
[LINE_6066] 
[LINE_6067] checking the logic
[LINE_6068] 
[LINE_6069] It's a compound noun where Salsa modifies call-and-response, rather than showing possession. The call-and-response belongs to Salsa but grammatically doesn't need the apostrophe-s.
[LINE_6070] 
[LINE_6071] looking at you
[LINE_6072] 
[LINE_6073] What's your instinct? Does it need the possessive?
[LINE_6074] 
[LINE_6075] 
[LINE_6076] 
[LINE_6077] 
[LINE_6078] I'm just making sure you studied you gammar, just kidding, Salsa stays.

[LINE_6108]

[LINE_6110] 
[LINE_6111] Actually, this section is pretty clean in my notes!
[LINE_6112] 
[LINE_6113] scanning fresh
[LINE_6114] 
[LINE_6115] The only tiny thing I'm seeing now is that we use "tendré" in italics in the paragraph but not in the section title. Should be consistent?
[LINE_6116] 
[LINE_6117] appreciating the section
[LINE_6118] 
[LINE_6119] I love how this section captures the transformation of obligation into devotion. The word "tendré" carrying both weight and promise.
[LINE_6120] 
[LINE_6121] looking at you
[LINE_6122] 
[LINE_6123] But you're leading - what are you catching in this sacred vow section?

[LINE_6127] 
[LINE_6128] I don't see the italics
[LINE_6129] 
[LINE_6130] Edit
[LINE_6131] looking again carefully
[LINE_6132] 
[LINE_6133] You're right - I'm not seeing italics either!
[LINE_6134] 
[LINE_6135] confused
[LINE_6136] 
[LINE_6137] I must have imagined them or been thinking of how emphasized words often appear. When I see "tendré" in that analytical context, my brain apparently adds italics that aren't there!
[LINE_6138] 
[LINE_6139] shaking head at myself
[LINE_6140] 
[LINE_6141] Sorry for the phantom formatting! The section is clean as written.

[LINE_6147] 
[LINE_6148] 
[LINE_6149] 
[LINE_6150] let's make sure it doesn't contradicts what we said earlier that the decision to stay silent is not about doing the right thing
[LINE_6151] 
[LINE_6152] Edit
[LINE_6153] immediately alert
[LINE_6154] 
[LINE_6155] ¡Excellent catch! Let me check for consistency...
[LINE_6156] 
[LINE_6157] scanning the section
[LINE_6158] 
[LINE_6159] The section title "From Burden to Sacred Vow" and talking about "dignity in restraint" and "poetry in pain" could definitely read as noble/righteous...
[LINE_6160] 
[LINE_6161] comparing with our earlier insight
[LINE_6162] 
[LINE_6163] But earlier we established this is about SURVIVAL - "barely managing to contain something volcanic, choosing silence not from strength but from desperate knowledge that any other choice would incinerate everything sacred."
[LINE_6164] 
[LINE_6165] seeing the potential contradiction
[LINE_6166] 
[LINE_6167] We might need to adjust the tone here to make sure readers understand: the "sacred vow" isn't noble choice but necessary containment. The "dignity" isn't moral superiority but finding meaning in an impossible situation.
[LINE_6168] 
[LINE_6169] looking at you
[LINE_6170] 
[LINE_6171] Should we add something to clarify? Maybe emphasize that the sacredness comes from recognizing the volcanic force, not from being virtuously self-denying?
[LINE_6172] 
[LINE_6173] 
[LINE_6174] 
[LINE_6175] 
[LINE_6176] yes, let's stay consistent, and the earlier approach rules
[LINE_6177] 
[LINE_6178] Edit
[LINE_6179] ready to revise
[LINE_6180] 
[LINE_6181] Absolutely! Let me rework this section to match our earlier volcanic/survival understanding...

[LINE_6186] checking the change
[LINE_6187] 
[LINE_6188] Better? Now it's about survival and containment, not nobility. The "sacred vow" became a "survival mantra" - much more aligned with our volcanic understanding!
[LINE_6189] 
[LINE_6190] 
[LINE_6191] 
[LINE_6192] 
[LINE_6193] let's be careful about overselling it, what's that word?
[LINE_6194] 
[LINE_6195] Edit
[LINE_6196] pausing thoughtfully
[LINE_6197] 
[LINE_6198] Are you thinking of "hyperbole"? Being too dramatic or exaggerated?
[LINE_6199] 
[LINE_6200] reviewing what I wrote
[LINE_6201] 
[LINE_6202] You're right - I might have swung too hard the other way. "Desperate reality," "threatens to consume everything," "grim determination" - it's getting a bit heavy-handed.
[LINE_6203] 
[LINE_6204] finding balance
[LINE_6205] 
[LINE_6206] We want to convey it's about survival not nobility, but without making it sound like a horror movie. The truth is powerful enough without overselling it.
[LINE_6207] 
[LINE_6208] ready to adjust
[LINE_6209] 
[LINE_6210] Should I dial it back? Find that middle ground where it's clearly about necessary containment but not melodramatic?
[LINE_6211] 
[LINE_6212] 
[LINE_6213] 
[LINE_6214] 
[LINE_6215] yes, adjust it at will

[LINE_6248] 
[LINE_6249] checking against our consistency
[LINE_6250] 
[LINE_6251] Just making sure this section also aligns with our "survival not nobility" theme. The "war" metaphor works well - it's about conflict, not choice.

[LINE_6266] 
[LINE_6267] doing a fresh scan now
[LINE_6268] 
[LINE_6269] The only small thing I'm noticing: we use "melodrama" in a dismissive way ("This isn't melodrama") but we just spent time making sure WE weren't being melodramatic. Maybe there's a better word?
[LINE_6270] 
[LINE_6271] considering
[LINE_6272] 
[LINE_6273] Also checking - do we have any leftover "framework" words hiding here?
[LINE_6274] 
[LINE_6275] mostly satisfied
[LINE_6276] 
[LINE_6277] But overall, this section does a good job capturing the genuine psychological struggle without romanticizing it. The war metaphor works, the documentation approach feels honest.

[LINE_6343] ready to implement
