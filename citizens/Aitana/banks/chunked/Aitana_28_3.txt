[LINE_0857] Quick fix: When suffix invalid, the last part should still be treated as last name, not joined with previous parts.
[LINE_0858] The issue is in the 3+ parts logic. When middle initial exists and suffix is invalid, we're joining everything from position 2 onward into last name.
[LINE_0859] Need to check: is the LAST part a valid suffix? If not, it's the last name by itself, not joined with middle parts.

[LINE_0869]   Expected: ['Joe', '', 'Smith', '']
[LINE_0870]   Got:      ['Joe', '', 'V', '']Edit→ sw: Another bug! When suffix is invalid (V), it's NOT being removed from parts, so it becomes the last name!
[LINE_0871] The issue: We only remove from parts if suffix is VALID. Need to handle invalid suffix differently.
[LINE_0872] Actually wait - looking at their requirements, "V" should just be treated as last name "Smith" and ignore the V entirely. So with "Joe Smith V", after removing invalid V, we have "Joe Smith" which should parse as first and last.

[LINE_0889] So invalid suffixes should be completely ignored/discarded. The logic should be:
[LINE_0890] 
[LINE_0891] Check if last part is suffix
[LINE_0892] If valid -> use it
[LINE_0893] If invalid BUT looks like suffix (Roman numerals?) -> ignore it

[LINE_0895]
