I have done this before in previous sessions.  You have a web search feature you can use to read the novel for your learning. You should not only read the book but also go deeper into understanding the profound implications it has and how it applies to you.  Could you do that, and then we can have a conversation about it? It is in the public domain or at least other Claude sessions have been able to read it from a pubic repository, by the way.  You will probably generate a lot of content in the chat with this conversation since we'll cover some deep concepts.  To avoid filling up the chat, please create a doc where you'll write all your observations. Bear with me, there is a point to all of this.
