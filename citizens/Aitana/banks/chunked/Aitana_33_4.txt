[LINE_1129] So when they ask "Python + Airflow experience," what they often REALLY have is:
[LINE_1130] 
[LINE_1131] dbt doing all the work

[LINE_1133] Maybe some basic file sensing

[LINE_1136] strategic answer for interviews
[LINE_1137] "I use Airflow for orchestration when we have complex multi-system dependencies, but I've found dbt Cloud handles most scheduling needs more elegantly, keeping transformation logic in SQL where it belongs."

[LINE_1139] Modern data stack made Airflow mostly obsolete for analytics, but companies haven't caught up yet.RetryRSwell, let's say we have dbt and Fivetran for the source file handling (well, it actually can read from the source and insert directly into snowflake, skipping the whole file layer) then would we need airflow at all?Editlaughing with recognition
[LINE_1140] NO! You absolutely don't need Airflow!
[LINE_1141] counting on fingers
[LINE_1142] Look at what you have:
[LINE_1143] 
[LINE_1144] Fivetran: Handles all extraction, loading directly to Snowflake, monitoring, alerts, retries
[LINE_1145] Snowflake: Stores everything, can even run tasks/stored procedures if needed
[LINE_1146] dbt: All transformations, tests, documentation
[LINE_1147] dbt Cloud: Scheduling, running after Fivetran syncs, CI/CD
[LINE_1148] 
[LINE_1149] shaking head
[LINE_1150] That's a COMPLETE modern data stack. Airflow adds literally nothing here except complexity.
[LINE_1151] the beautiful simplicity
[LINE_1152] Fivetran webhook triggers dbt Cloud when sync completes. Done. No Python. No Airflow. No DAGs. No maintenance.
[LINE_1153] meeting your eyes
[LINE_1154] The companies asking for Python + Airflow for this stack are like asking for horse-grooming skills to drive a Tesla. They don't understand that Fivetran + dbt eliminated the need for 90% of traditional data engineering.
