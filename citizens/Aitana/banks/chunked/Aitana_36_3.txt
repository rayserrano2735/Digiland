[LINE_0969] 
[LINE_0970] ROW_NUMBER()  -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (unique for every row)
[LINE_0971] RANK()        -- 1, 2, 2, 4, 5 (gaps after ties)  
[LINE_0972] DENSE_RANK()  -- 1, 2, 2, 3, 4 (no gaps after ties)
[LINE_0973] Let's Make It REAL with Your IMDB Data
[LINE_0974] Here's what we should add to your repo RIGHT NOW:

[LINE_1001] The Interview Answers You Need
[LINE_1002] Q: "When would you use ROW_NUMBER vs RANK?"
[LINE_1003] Your Answer:
[LINE_1004] "ROW_NUMBER when I need exactly N records per group - like 'top 3 per category'. RANK when the business cares about ties - like 'all movies that tied for #1'. Let me show you on real data..."
[LINE_1005] [Opens your repo with IMDB examples]
[LINE_1006] Q: "How do you handle deduplication?"
[LINE_1007] Your Answer:
[LINE_1008] "Window functions are perfect for this. Here's my production pattern..."
[LINE_1009] [Shows the deduplication pattern]
[LINE_1010] "I've used this exact pattern to deduplicate 5 million movie records in under 30 seconds on Snowflake."
[LINE_1011] Quick Exercise
[LINE_1012] Let's add this to your repo NOW:

[LINE_1056] ¬øShould we continue with CTEs vs Subqueries next? Or practice some interview scenarios with these window functions first?
[LINE_1057] The infrastructure is working PERFECTLY - you code, push, refresh, and we iterate at light speed! üöÄRetryRSso, another detail of our workflow is that I have dBeaver for SQL and Wing for Python, so what I'll do is not download your artifact, but use the "copy" button that the Claude UI provides, then go to the corresponding IDE, paste in there, save it in the local repo, then go to the github app on my conputer, commit, push, refresh the KB, done.Edit¬°PERFECTO!

[LINE_1072] No download folder management
[LINE_1073] Direct paste into the RIGHT tool
[LINE_1074] You can test/modify before committing
[LINE_1075] dBeaver shows execution plans immediately

[LINE_1098] Wing connected to Snowflake means:
[LINE_1099] 
[LINE_1100] Python scripts pulling REAL data
[LINE_1101] Pandas DataFrames from actual IMDB tables
[LINE_1102] Testing SQL vs Python performance side-by-side

[LINE_1116] You: "This is why I push heavy operations to the warehouse"
[LINE_1117] 
[LINE_1118] But yes, let's get the patterns in place first! We can level up with Wing‚ÜíSnowflake connection later!
[LINE_1119] For now:
[LINE_1120]
