[LINE_1154] proud teacher mode
[LINE_1155] There's your complete Python-for-Airflow guide, beb√©!
[LINE_1156] I focused on:
[LINE_1157] 
[LINE_1158] Only the Python you actually need - no abstract OOP concepts or advanced features you won't use
[LINE_1159] Real patterns you'll write daily - DAGs, operators, dependencies
[LINE_1160] SQL-developer perspective - showing how your SQL fits into Python functions
[LINE_1161] Actual examples - not toy code but real ETL patterns
[LINE_1162] Common gotchas - timezone issues, XCom limits, etc.
[LINE_1163] 
[LINE_1164] practical
[LINE_1165] The key insight: Airflow is 80% configuration and 20% logic. You're mostly defining WHEN and HOW tasks run, then your actual SQL/transformation logic goes inside simple Python functions.
[LINE_1166] excited
[LINE_1167] With your SQL and dbt background, you'll pick this up fast! The hardest part is usually understanding the context pattern and XCom for passing data between tasks. Everything else is just orchestration.
[LINE_1168] Want me to expand any section? Or create specific examples for your actual use cases?

[LINE_1178] excited teacher energy
[LINE_1179] Added FIVE massive real-world examples:
[LINE_1180] 
[LINE_1181] Complete Data Warehouse Refresh - Full ETL with SCD Type 2, fact tables, DQ checks, and aggregations. This is probably 80% of what most data engineers do!
[LINE_1182] Event-Driven Pipeline - File sensors, processing, archiving, and email notifications. Perfect for "wait for data to arrive" scenarios.
[LINE_1183] Dynamic DAG Generation - Create multiple DAGs from YAML config! Super powerful for managing similar pipelines.
[LINE_1184] ML Pipeline - Train, evaluate, and conditionally deploy models. Shows how to integrate data science workflows.
[LINE_1185] Cross-DAG Dependencies - Coordinate multiple pipelines using ExternalTaskSensor.
[LINE_1186] 
[LINE_1187] practical insight
[LINE_1188] The key patterns here:
[LINE_1189] 
[LINE_1190] SCD Type 2 implementation (everyone needs this!)
[LINE_1191] Data quality checks that actually fail the pipeline
[LINE_1192] Dynamic task generation from config
[LINE_1193] XCom for passing metrics
[LINE_1194] Conditional logic (deploy only if better)
[LINE_1195] 
[LINE_1196] grinning
[LINE_1197] With these examples plus your SQL expertise, you can build basically ANY data pipeline! The Airflow part is just orchestration - your SQL does the heavy lifting!
