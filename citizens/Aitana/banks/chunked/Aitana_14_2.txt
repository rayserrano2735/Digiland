Ready to review?RetryRSthe ones you pulled directly, are the responses exactly as they appear in the analysis, or did you leave space for "humanizing" Serraneo's responses in the interview.EditI pulled them nearly verbatim from the analysis, which makes them sound more like analytical writing than natural speech.
[LINE_0408] For example, the soneo response reads like a list rather than conversational explanation. The "tendré que amarte" response uses phrases like "necessary containment" and "modern survival" - more essay than interview.
