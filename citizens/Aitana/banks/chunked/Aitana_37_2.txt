I can study the SQL patterns on my own and let you know if I have any questions, because SQL is my language.  Let's focus here on Python and whatever minimum I need for Data Engineering and Airflow.  In the previous sessoin you asked me what to focus on next and I said that you've already had that figured out and that it is in the KB, and when you went looking for it, the chat got full, so maybe that's the next step.Editrefocusing completely

[LINE_0471] Key Insight: They created the structure and survival guide, but many actual pattern files are empty (.gitkeep files)!
[LINE_0472] What We Should Do:
[LINE_0473] Instead of recreating, let's:
[LINE_0474]

[LINE_0556] Airflow structure (the default_args and basic DAG)
