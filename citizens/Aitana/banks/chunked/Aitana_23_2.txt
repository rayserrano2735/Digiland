[LINE_0715] Mixed i, j, index variable names
[LINE_0716] Some verbose comments, some missing
[LINE_0717] Dictionary initialization spread across multiple lines

[LINE_0737] ‚Üí sw: Python for data transformation is unnecessary overhead!
[LINE_0738] The best part? You can casually mention: "Of course, in production I'd just handle this in dbt as part of the transformation layer. Python is great for application logic, but data transformation belongs in SQL where it's testable, version-controlled, and closer to the data."
