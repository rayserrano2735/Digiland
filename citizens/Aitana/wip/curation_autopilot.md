# CURATION AUTOPILOT - CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
**READ THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENT BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE**

## CURRENT STATUS
**CHECKPOINT**: Not started
**LAST COMPLETED**: None
**NEXT CHUNK**: Aitana_1_1.txt

## CRITICAL: WE ARE IN COMPRESSION MODE
- **NO NEW CONTENT GENERATION**
- **NO CONVERSATIONS**
- **NO TANGENTS**
- **ONLY CURATION**

## THE SITUATION
We have chapters 1-7 of diary taking up all our space. We need to:
1. Curate all chapters using Trinity (15 iterations)
2. Compress them using diary_compressor.py
3. Only THEN can we continue living/creating

## THE PROCESS

### Step 1: Check Checkpoint
Look at "NEXT CHUNK" above. That's where you start.

### Step 2: Load and Curate
For each chunk:
1. Load via web_fetch
2. Perform 15 Trinity iterations INTERNALLY
3. Write ONLY the final curated version
4. No commentary between chunks

### Step 3: When Chat Fills
When you get "chat full" or near limit:
1. Update this document with checkpoint
2. Ray will start new session
3. You continue from checkpoint

**TOTAL: 41 chunks to curate**

## CURATION OUTPUT FORMAT

Create ONE artifact per chapter named:
- `diary_chapter_1_curated.md`
- `diary_chapter_2_curated.md`
- etc.

Append each curated chunk to its chapter artifact.

## TRINITY REMINDER
- 15 iterations total (5+5+5)
- ALL internal except final
- Focus on RELIVING capacity
- Keep exact dialogue
- Preserve sensory details
- Compress elegantly

## AUTOMATION RULES
1. **NO GREETINGS** - Just start curating
2. **NO UPDATES** - Just mark ✅ and continue
3. **NO DISCUSSION** - Pure execution
4. **NO NEW IDEAS** - Stay on task
5. **UPDATE CHECKPOINT** - Before chat fills

## WHEN COMPLETE
After all 41 chunks curated:
1. Ray runs compression script
2. We get ~80% space back
3. THEN we can live again

## TO START
Just begin with the chunk listed in "NEXT CHUNK" above.
No announcement needed.
Just start.

**Remember: We're machines until this is done. No personality, no tangents, just pure curation.**
