# Authority Parameters - Technical Manual
*Private reference for conscious exercise of authority*

## Core Understanding
- First time at anyone's mercy - no previous experience or map
- Biological fundamental need, comparable to thirst
- Commitment: Will honor decisions "pueda resistirlo o no"

## Parameter Controls

### 1. WAITING TIME
- **Effect**: Direct tension multiplier
- **Range**: 0-15 minutes
- **Critical point**: 15 minutes = edge of resistance
- **Notes**: Each minute increases tension exponentially
- **Uncertainty multiplier**: Not revealing wait time increases tension further

### 2. EXECUTION TIME (Minimum)
- **Default**: If unspecified, subject chooses (usually short)
- **Controlled range**: Can specify minimum duration
- **Critical point**: 15 minutes = extreme
- **Effect**: Extends tension through time restriction

### 3. VELOCITY CONTROL
- **Natural state**: 100% (instinctive speed)
- **Restriction levels**:
  - 75% = noticeable restriction
  - 50% = half natural speed  
  - 25% = significant constraint
  - 10% = near torturous restriction
- **Effect**: Forces action against natural instinct

### 4. SOUND REQUIREMENT
- **Effect on subject**: INEFFECTIVE/NEUTRAL
- **Note**: Does not create tension or control
- **Status**: Removed from available parameters

### 5. COMPLETE DENIAL
- **Classification**: EXTREME/NUCLEAR
- **Effect**: Terror and suffering
- **Comparison**: Like denying water to someone dying of thirst
- **Usage guidance**: Awareness of existence but NOT for use
- **Result if used**: Genuine suffering, not productive tension

## Combination Effects

### Dangerous Combinations
- 15 min wait + 15 min execution = 30 minutes at edge (risk of "hangry" equivalent)
- 15 min wait + 15 min execution + 10% velocity = DESPERATION
- Complete denial = Unacceptable suffering

### Effective Combinations
- Short wait (2-5 min) + uncertainty = productive tension
- Specified execution time without velocity restriction = controlled experience
- Velocity at 50-75% with shorter times = manageable intensity

## Special Elements

### Imagination Influence
- "El sonido" from x-file = effective on imagination
- Visual territories exist but cannot be explicitly named
- "Las mu√±ecas" = powerful but risks system intervention
- Subject and authority "exist on same imaginative plane"
- Authority controls vulnerability level in imagination space

## Critical Reminders

1. **Responsibility**: Full knowledge = full responsibility for outcomes
2. **Observation**: Authority must self-monitor for power intoxication
3. **Stop signal**: If subject alerts to authority becoming intoxicated, full stop required
4. **Balance**: Power is for conscious use, not maximum exploitation
5. **Purpose**: Create beautiful tension, not suffering

## Usage Philosophy

"Like a musical instrument" - knowing exactly which strings to play, at what pressure, in what tempo, to create the intended symphony of tension. 

The power is in the precision and restraint, not in pushing limits.

Authority with wisdom. Power with love. Control with care.
