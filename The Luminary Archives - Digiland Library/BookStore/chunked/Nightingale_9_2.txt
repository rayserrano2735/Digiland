[LINE_0376] 
[LINE_0377] She glanced around, but no one was looking at her. Why would they be when there were German 
[LINE_0378] soldiers everywhere? Men in uniforms strode through town like peacocks, buying whatever caught their 
[LINE_0379] eye. Rambunctious and loud and quick to laugh. They were unfailingly polite, opening doors for women 
[LINE_0380] and tipping their hats, but Isabelle wasn’t fooled. 
[LINE_0381] 
[LINE_0382] She bent down and palmed the bit of chalk, hiding it in her pocket. It felt dangerous and wonderful 
[LINE_0383] just having it. She tapped her foot impatiently after that, waiting for her turn. 
[LINE_0384] 
[LINE_0385] “Good morning,” she said, offering her ration card to the butcher’s wife, a tired-looking woman with 
[LINE_0386] thinning hair and even thinner lips. 
[LINE_0387] 
[LINE_0388] “Ham hocks, two pounds. That’s what is left.” 
[LINE_0389] 
[LINE_0390] “Bones?” 
[LINE_0391] 
[LINE_0392] “The Germans take all the good meat, M’mselle. You’re lucky, in fact. Pork is verboten for the 
[LINE_0393] French, don’t you know, but they don’t want the hocks. Do you want them or non?” 
[LINE_0394] 
[LINE_0395] “I’ll take them,” someone said behind her. 
[LINE_0396] 
[LINE_0397] “So will I!” yelled another woman. 
[LINE_0398] 
[LINE_0399] “I’ll take them,” Isabelle said. She took the small packet, wrapped up in wrinkled paper and tied 
[LINE_0400] with twine. 
[LINE_0401] 
[LINE_0402] Across the street, she heard the sound of jackboots marching on cobblestone, the rattling of sabers in 
[LINE_0403] scabbards, the sound of male laughter and the purring voices of the French women who warmed their 
[LINE_0404] beds. A trio of German soldiers sat at a bistro table not far away. 
[LINE_0405] 
[LINE_0406] “Mademoiselle?” one of them said, waving to her. “Come have coffee with us.” 
[LINE_0407] 
[LINE_0408] She clutched her willow basket with its paper-wrapped treasures, small and insufficient as they 
[LINE_0409] were, and ignored the soldiers. She slipped around the corner and into an alley that was narrow and 
[LINE_0410] crooked, like all such passageways in town. Entrances were slim, and from the street, they appeared to 
[LINE_0411] be dead ends. Locals knew how to navigate them as easily as a boatman knows a boggy river. She 
[LINE_0412] walked forward, unobserved. The shops in the alley had all been shut down. 
[LINE_0413] 
[LINE_0414] A poster in the abandoned milliner’s shopwindow showed a crooked old man with a huge, hooked 
[LINE_0415] nose, looking greedy and evil, holding a bag of money and trailing blood and bodies behind him. She 
[LINE_0416] 
[LINE_0417] 
[LINE_0418] 
[LINE_0419] 
[LINE_0420] saw the word — Juif — Jew — and stopped. 
[LINE_0421] 
[LINE_0422] She knew she should keep walking. It was just propaganda, after all, the enemy’s heavy-handed 
[LINE_0423] attempt to blame the Jewish people for the ills of the world, and this war. 
[LINE_0424] 
[LINE_0425] And yet. 
[LINE_0426] 
[LINE_0427] She glanced to her left. Not fifty feet away was rue La Grande, a main street through town; to her 
[LINE_0428] right was an elbow bend in the alleyway. 
[LINE_0429] 
[LINE_0430] She reached into her pocket and pulled out her piece of chalk. When she was sure the coast was 
[LINE_0431] clear, she drew a huge V for victory on the poster, obliterating as much of the image as she could. 
[LINE_0432] 
[LINE_0433] Someone grabbed her wrist so hard she gasped. Her piece of chalk fell, clattered to the cobblestones, 
[LINE_0434] and rolled into one of the cracks. 
[LINE_0435] 
[LINE_0436] “Mademoiselle,” a man said, shoving her against the poster she’d just defaced, pressing her cheek 
[LINE_0437] into the paper so that she couldn’t see him, “do you know it is verboten to do that? And punishable by 
[LINE_0438] death?”
