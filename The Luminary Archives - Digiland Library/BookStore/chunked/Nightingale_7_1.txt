[LINE_0002] 
[LINE_0003] 
[LINE_0004] 
[LINE_0005] The ecole elementaire was not a big school by city standards, but it was spacious and well laid out, 
[LINE_0006] plenty large enough for the children of the commune of Carriveau. Before its life as a school, the 
[LINE_0007] building had been stables for a rich landowner, and thus its U-shape design; the central courtyard had 
[LINE_0008] been a gathering place for carriages and tradesmen. It boasted gray stone walls, bright blue shutters, and 
[LINE_0009] wooden floors. The manor house, to which it had once been aligned, had been bombed in the Great War 
[LINE_0010] and never rebuilt. Like so many schools in the small towns in France, it stood on the far edge of town. 
[LINE_0011] 
[LINE_0012] Vianne was in her classroom, behind her desk, staring out at the shining children’s faces in front of 
[LINE_0013] her, dabbing her upper lip with her wrinkled handkerchief. On the floor by each child’s desk was the 
[LINE_0014] obligatory gas mask. Children now carried them everywhere. 
[LINE_0015] 
[LINE_0016] The open windows and thick stone walls helped to keep the sun at bay, but still the heat was stifling. 
[LINE_0017] Lord knew, it was hard enough to concentrate without the added burden of the heat. The news from 
[LINE_0018] Paris was terrible, terrifying. All anyone could talk about was the gloomy future and the shocking 
[LINE_0019] present: Germans in Paris. The Maginot Line broken. French soldiers dead in trenches and running from 
[LINE_0020] the front. For the last three nights — since the telephone call from her father — she hadn’t slept. Isabelle 
[LINE_0021] was God-knew- where between Paris and Carriveau, and there had been no word from Antoine. 
[LINE_0022] 
[LINE_0023] “Who wants to conjugate the verb courir for me?” she asked tiredly. 
[LINE_0024] 
[LINE_0025] “Shouldn’t we be learning German?” 
[LINE_0026] 
[LINE_0027] Vianne realized what she’d just been asked. The students were interested now, sitting upright, their 
[LINE_0028] eyes bright. 
[LINE_0029] 
[LINE_0030] “Pardon?” she said, clearing her throat, buying time. 
[LINE_0031] 
[LINE_0032] “We should be learning German, not French.” 
[LINE_0033] 
[LINE_0034] It was young Gilles Fournier, the butcher’s son. His father and all three of his older brothers had 
[LINE_0035] gone off to the war, leaving only him and his mother to run the family’s butcher shop. 
[LINE_0036] 
[LINE_0037] “And shooting,” Francois agreed, nodding his head. “My maman says we will need to know how to 
[LINE_0038] shoot Germans, too.” 
[LINE_0039] 
[LINE_0040] “My grandmere says we should all just leave,” said Claire. “She remembers the last war and she 
[LINE_0041] says we are fools for staying.” 
[LINE_0042] 
[LINE_0043] “The Germans won’t cross the Loire, will they, Madame Mauriac?” 
[LINE_0044] 
[LINE_0045] 
[LINE_0046] 
[LINE_0047] In the front row, center, Sophie sat forward in her seat, her hands clasped atop the wooden desk, her 
[LINE_0048] eyes wide. She had been as upset by the rumors as Vianne. The child had cried herself to sleep two 
[LINE_0049] nights in a row, worrying over her father. Now Bebe came to school with her. Sarah sat in the desk 
[LINE_0050] beside her best friend, looking equally fearful. 
[LINE_0051] 
[LINE_0052] “It is all right to be afraid,” Vianne said, moving toward them. It was what she’d said to Sophie last 
[LINE_0053] night and to herself, but the words rang hollow. 
[LINE_0054] 
[LINE_0055] “I’m not afraid,” Gilles said. “I got a knife. I’ll kill any dirty Boches who show up in Carriveau.” 
[LINE_0056] 
[LINE_0057] Sarah’s eyes widened. “They’re coming here?” 
[LINE_0058] 
[LINE_0059] “No,” Vianne said. The denial didn’t come easily; her own fear caught at the word, stretched it out. 
[LINE_0060] “The French soldiers — your fathers and uncles and brothers — are the bravest men in the world. I’m sure 
[LINE_0061] they are fighting for Paris and Tours and Orleans even as we speak.” 
[LINE_0062] 
[LINE_0063] “But Paris is overrun,” Gilles said. “What happened to the French soldiers at the front?” 
[LINE_0064] 
[LINE_0065] “In wars, there are battles and skirmishes. Losses along the way. But our men will never let the 
[LINE_0066] Germans win. We will never give up.” She moved closer to her students. “But we have a part to play, 
[LINE_0067] too; those of us left behind. We have to be brave and strong, too, and not believe the worst. We have to 
[LINE_0068] keep on with our lives so our fathers and brothers and . . . husbands have lives to come home to, oui ?” 
[LINE_0069] 
[LINE_0070] “But what about Tante Isabelle?” Sophie asked. “Grandpere said she should have been here by 
[LINE_0071] now.” 
[LINE_0072] 
[LINE_0073] “My cousin ran from Paris, too,” Francois said. “He is not arrived here, either.” 
[LINE_0074] 
[LINE_0075] “My uncle says it is bad on the roads.” 
[LINE_0076] 
[LINE_0077] The bell rang and students popped from their seats like springs. In an instant the war, the aeroplanes, 
[LINE_0078] the fear were forgotten. They were eight- and nine-year-olds freed at the end of a summer school day, 
[LINE_0079] and they acted like it. Yelling, laughing, talking all at once, pushing one another aside, running for the 
[LINE_0080] door. 
[LINE_0081] 
[LINE_0082] Vianne was thankful for the bell. She was a teacher, for God’s sake. What did she know to say about 
[LINE_0083] dangers such as these? How could she assuage a child’s fear when her own was straining at the leash? 
[LINE_0084] She busied herself with ordinary tasks — gathering up the detriti that sixteen children left behind, 
[LINE_0085] banging chalk from the soft erasers, putting books away. When everything was as it should be, she put 
[LINE_0086] her papers and pencils into her own leather satchel and took her handbag out of the desk’s bottom 
[LINE_0087] drawer. Then she put on her straw hat, pinned it in place, and left her classroom. 
[LINE_0088] 
[LINE_0089] She walked down the quiet hallways, waving to colleagues who were still in their classrooms. 
[LINE_0090] Several of the rooms were closed up now that the male teachers had been mobilized. 
[LINE_0091] 
[LINE_0092] At Rachel’s classroom, she paused, watching as Rachel put her son in his pram and wheeled it 
[LINE_0093] toward the door. Rachel had been planning to take this term off from teaching to stay home with Ari, 
[LINE_0094] but the war had changed all of that. Now, she had no choice but to bring her baby to work with her. 
[LINE_0095] 
[LINE_0096] “You look like I feel,” Vianne said as her friend neared. Rachel’s dark hair had responded to the 
[LINE_0097] humidity and doubled in size. 
[LINE_0098] 
[LINE_0099] “That can’t be a compliment but I’m desperate, so I am taking it as one. You have chalk on your 
[LINE_0100] 
[LINE_0101] 
[LINE_0102] 
[LINE_0103] cheek, by the way.” 
[LINE_0104] 
[LINE_0105] Vianne wiped her cheek absently and leaned over the pram. The baby was sleeping soundly. “How’s 
[LINE_0106] he doing?” 
[LINE_0107] 
[LINE_0108] “For a ten-month-old who is supposed to be at home with his maman and is instead gallivanting 
[LINE_0109] around town beneath enemy aeroplanes and listening to ten-year-old students shriek all day? Fine.” She 
[LINE_0110] smiled and pushed a damp ringlet from her face as they headed down the corridor. “Do I sound bitter?” 
[LINE_0111] 
[LINE_0112] “No more than the rest of us.” 
[LINE_0113] 
[LINE_0114] “Ha! Bitterness would do you good. All that smiling and pretending of yours would give me hives.” 
[LINE_0115] 
[LINE_0116] Rachel bumped the pram down the three stone steps and onto the walkway that led to the grassy 
[LINE_0117] play area that had once been an exercise arena for horses and a delivery area for tradesmen. A four- 
[LINE_0118] hundred-year-old stone fountain gurgled and dripped water in the center of the yard. 
[LINE_0119] 
[LINE_0120] “Come on, girls!” Rachel called out to Sophie and Sarah, who were sitting together on a park bench. 
[LINE_0121] The girls responded immediately and fell into step ahead of the women, chattering constantly, their 
[LINE_0122] heads cocked together, their hands clasped. A second generation of best friends. 
[LINE_0123] 
[LINE_0124] They turned into an alleyway and came out on rue Victor Hugo, right in front of a bistro where old 
[LINE_0125] men sat on ironwork chairs, drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes and talking politics. Ahead of them, 
[LINE_0126] Vianne saw a haggard trio of women limping along, their clothes tattered, their faces yellow with dust. 
[LINE_0127] 
[LINE_0128] “Poor women,” Rachel said with a sigh. “Helene Ruelle told me this morning that at least a dozen 
[LINE_0129] refugees came to town late last night. The stories they bring are not good. But no one embellishes a 
[LINE_0130] story like Helene.” 
[LINE_0131] 
[LINE_0132] Ordinarily Vianne would make a comment about what a gossip Helene was, but she couldn’t be glib. 
[LINE_0133] According to Papa, Isabelle had left Paris days ago. She still hadn’t arrived at Le Jardin. “I’m worried 
[LINE_0134] about Isabelle,” she said. 
[LINE_0135] 
[LINE_0136] Rachel linked her arm through Vianne ’s. “Do you remember the first time your sister ran away from 
[LINE_0137] that boarding school in Lyon?” 
[LINE_0138] 
[LINE_0139] “She was seven years old.” 
[LINE_0140] 
[LINE_0141] “She made it all the way to Amboise. Alone. With no money. She spent two nights in the woods and 
[LINE_0142] talked her way onto the train.” 
[LINE_0143] 
[LINE_0144] Vianne barely remembered anything of that time except for her own grief. When she’d lost the first 
[LINE_0145] baby, she’d fallen into despair. The lost year, Antoine called it. That was how she thought of it, too. 
[LINE_0146] When Antoine told her he was taking Isabelle to Paris, and to Papa, Vianne had been — God help her — 
[LINE_0147] relieved. 
[LINE_0148] 
[LINE_0149] Was it any surprise that Isabelle had run away from the boarding school to which she’d been sent? 
[LINE_0150] To this day, Vianne felt an abiding shame at how she had treated her baby sister. 
[LINE_0151] 
[LINE_0152] “She was nine the first time she made it to Paris,” Vianne said, trying to find comfort in the familiar 
[LINE_0153] story. Isabelle was tough and driven and determined; she always had been. 
[LINE_0154] 
[LINE_0155] “If I’m not mistaken, she was expelled two years later for running away from school to see a 
[LINE_0156] traveling circus. Or was that when she climbed out of the second-floor dormitory window using a 
[LINE_0157] 
[LINE_0158] 
[LINE_0159] 
[LINE_0160] bedsheet?” Rachel smiled. “The point is, Isabelle will make it here if that’s what she wants.” 
[LINE_0161] 
[LINE_0162] “God help anyone who tries to stop her.” 
[LINE_0163] 
[LINE_0164] “She will arrive any day. I promise. Unless she has met an exiled prince and fallen desperately in 
[LINE_0165] love.” 
[LINE_0166] 
[LINE_0167] “That is the kind of thing that could happen to her.” 
[LINE_0168] 
[LINE_0169] “You see?” Rachel teased. “You feel better already. Now come to my house for lemonade. It’s just 
[LINE_0170] the thing on a day this hot.” 
[LINE_0171] 
[LINE_0172] 
[LINE_0173] 
[LINE_0174] After supper, Vianne got Sophie settled into bed and went downstairs. She was too worried to relax. The 
[LINE_0175] silence in her house kept reminding her that no one had come to her door. She could not remain still. 
[LINE_0176] Regardless of her conversation with Rachel, she couldn’t dispel her worry — and a terrible sense of 
[LINE_0177] foreboding — about Isabelle. 
[LINE_0178] 
[LINE_0179] Vianne stood up, sat down, then stood again and walked to the front door, opening it. 
[LINE_0180] 
[LINE_0181] Outside, the fields lay beneath a purple and pink evening sky. Her yard was a series of familiar 
[LINE_0182] shapes — well-tended apple trees stood protectively between the front door and the rose-and-vine- 
[LINE_0183] covered stone wall, beyond which lay the road to town and acres and acres of fields, studded here and 
[LINE_0184] there with thickets of narrow-trunked trees. Off to the right was the deeper woods where she and 
[LINE_0185] Antoine had often sneaked off to be alone when they were younger. 
[LINE_0186] 
[LINE_0187] Antoine. 
[LINE_0188] 
[LINE_0189] Isabelle. 
[LINE_0190] 
[LINE_0191] Where were they? Was he at the front? Was she walking from Paris? 
[LINE_0192] 
[LINE_0193] Don’t think about it. 
[LINE_0194] 
[LINE_0195] She needed to do something. Gardening. Keep her mind on something else. 
[LINE_0196] 
[LINE_0197] After retrieving her worn gardening gloves and stepping into the boots by the door, she made her 
[LINE_0198] way to the garden positioned on a flat patch of land between the shed and the barn. Potatoes, onions, 
[LINE_0199] carrots, broccoli, peas, beans, cucumbers, tomatoes, and radishes grew in its carefully tended beds. On 
[LINE_0200] the hillside between the garden and the barn were the berries — raspberries and blackberries in carefully 
[LINE_0201] contained rows. She knelt down in the rich, black dirt and began pulling weeds. 
[LINE_0202] 
[LINE_0203] Early summer was usually a time of promise. Certainly, things could go wrong in this most ard 
[LINE_0204] 
[LINE_0205] 
[LINE_0206] 
[LINE_0207] was what it gave her. In it, she found a sense of calm. 
[LINE_0208] 
[LINE_0209] She became aware of something wrong slowly, in pieces. First, there was a sound that didn’t belong, 
[LINE_0210] a vibration, a thudding, and then a murmur. The odors came next: something wholly at odds with her 
[LINE_0211] sweet garden smell, something acrid and sharp that made her think of decay. 
[LINE_0212] 
[LINE_0213] Vianne wiped her forehead, aware that she was smearing black dirt across her skin, and stood up. 
[LINE_0214] 
[LINE_0215] 
[LINE_0216] 
[LINE_0217] 
[LINE_0218] season, but if one remained steady and calm and didn’t shirk the all-important duties of weeding and 
[LINE_0219] thinning, the plants could be guided and tamed. Vianne always made sure that the beds were precisely 
[LINE_0220] organized and tended with a firm yet gentle hand. Even more important than what she gave her garden 
[LINE_0221] 
[LINE_0222] 
[LINE_0223] 
[LINE_0224] Tucking her dirty gloves in the gaping hip pockets of her pants, she rose to her feet and moved toward 
[LINE_0225] her gate. Before she reached it, a trio of women appeared, as if sculpted out of the shadows. They stood 
[LINE_0226] clumped together in the road just behind her gate. An old woman, dressed in rags, held the others close 
[LINE_0227] to her — a young woman with a babe-in-arms and a teenaged girl who held an empty birdcage in one 
[LINE_0228] hand and a shovel in the other. Each looked glassy-eyed and feverish; the young mother was clearly 
[LINE_0229] trembling. Their faces were dripping with sweat, their eyes were filled with defeat. The old woman held 
[LINE_0230] out dirty, empty hands. “Can you spare some water?” she asked, but even as she asked her the question, 
[LINE_0231] she looked unconvinced. Beaten. 
[LINE_0232] 
[LINE_0233] Vianne opened the gate. “Of course. Would you like to come in? Sit down, perhaps?” 
[LINE_0234] 
[LINE_0235] The old woman shook her head. “We are ahead of them. There’s nothing for those in the back.” 
[LINE_0236] 
[LINE_0237] Vianne didn’t know what the woman meant, but it didn’t matter. She could see that the women were 
[LINE_0238] suffering from exhaustion and hunger. “Just a moment.” She went into the house and packed them some 
[LINE_0239] bread and raw carrots and a small bit of cheese. All that she had to spare. She filled a wine bottle with 
[LINE_0240] water and returned, offering them the provisions. “It’s not much,” she said. 
[LINE_0241] 
[LINE_0242] “It is more than we’ve had since Tours,” the young woman said in a toneless voice. 
[LINE_0243] 
[LINE_0244] “You were in Tours?” Vianne asked. 
[LINE_0245] 
[LINE_0246] “Drink, Sabine,” the old woman said, holding the water to the girl’s lips. 
[LINE_0247] 
[LINE_0248] Vianne was about to ask about Isabelle when the old woman said sharply, “They’re here.” 
[LINE_0249] 
[LINE_0250] The young mother made a moaning sound and tightened her hold on the baby, who was so quiet — 
[LINE_0251] and his tiny fist so blue — that Vianne gasped. 
[LINE_0252] 
[LINE_0253] The baby was dead. 
[LINE_0254] 
[LINE_0255] Vianne knew about the kind of talon grief that wouldn’t let go; she had fallen into the fathomless 
[LINE_0256] gray that warped a mind and made a mother keep holding on long after hope was gone. 
[LINE_0257] 
[LINE_0258] “Go inside,” the old woman said to Vianne. “Lock your doors.” 
[LINE_0259] 
[LINE_0260] “But...” 
[LINE_0261] 
[LINE_0262] The ragged trio backed away — lurched, really — as if Vianne’s breath had become noxious. 
[LINE_0263] 
[LINE_0264] And then she saw the mass of black shapes moving across the field and coming up the road. 
[LINE_0265] 
[LINE_0266] The smell preceded them. Human sweat and filth and body odor. As they neared, the miasma__pf 
[LINE_0267] black separated, peeled into forms. She saw people on the road and in the fields; walking, limping, 
[LINE_0268] coming toward her. Some were pushing bicycles or prams or dragging wagons. Dogs barked, babies 
[LINE_0269] cried. There was coughing, throat clearing, whining. They came forward, through the field and up the 
[LINE_0270] road, relentlessly moving closer, pushing one another aside, their voices rising. 
[LINE_0271] 
[LINE_0272] Vianne couldn’t help so many. She rushed into her house and locked the door behind her. Inside, she 
[LINE_0273] went from room to room, locking doors and closing shutters. When she was finished, she stood in the 
[LINE_0274] living room, uncertain, her heart pounding. 
[LINE_0275] 
[LINE_0276] The house began to shake, just a little. The windows rattled, the shutters thumped against the stone 
[LINE_0277] exterior. Dust rained down from the exposed timbers of the ceiling. 
[LINE_0278] 
[LINE_0279] Someone pounded on the front door. It went on and on and on, fists landing on the front door in 
[LINE_0280] 
[LINE_0281] 
[LINE_0282] 
[LINE_0283] 
[LINE_0284] hammer blows that made Vianne flinch. 
[LINE_0285] 
[LINE_0286] Sophie came running down the stairs, clutching Bebe to her chest. “Maman!” 
[LINE_0287] 
[LINE_0288] Vianne opened her arms and Sophie ran into her embrace. Vianne held her daughter close as the 
[LINE_0289] onslaught increased. Someone pounded on the side door. The copper pots and pans hanging in the 
[LINE_0290] kitchen clanged together, made a sound like church bells. She heard the high squealing of the outdoor 
[LINE_0291] pump. They were getting water. 
[LINE_0292] 
[LINE_0293] Vianne said to Sophie, “Wait here one moment. Sit on the divan.” 
[LINE_0294] 
[LINE_0295] “Don’t leave me!” 
[LINE_0296] 
[LINE_0297] Vianne peeled her daughter away and forced her to sit down. Taking an iron poker from the side of 
[LINE_0298] the fireplace, she crept cautiously up the stairs. From the safety of her bedroom, she peered out the 
[LINE_0299] window, careful to remain hidden. 
[LINE_0300] 
[LINE_0301] There were dozens of people in her yard; mostly women and children, moving like a pack of hungry 
[LINE_0302] wolves. Their voices melded into a single desperate growl. 
[LINE_0303] 
[LINE_0304] Vianne backed away. What if the doors didn’t hold? So many people could break down doors and 
[LINE_0305] windows, even walls. 
[LINE_0306] 
[LINE_0307] Terrified, she went back downstairs, not breathing until she saw Sophie still safe on the divan. 
[LINE_0308] Vianne sat down beside her daughter and took her in her arms, letting Sophie curl up as if she were a 
[LINE_0309] much littler girl. She stroked her daughter’s curly hair. A better mother, a stronger mother, would have 
[LINE_0310] had a story to tell right now, but Vianne was so afraid that her voice had gone completely. All she could 
[LINE_0311] think was an endless, beginningless prayer. Please. 
[LINE_0312] 
[LINE_0313] She pulled Sophie closer and said, “Go to sleep, Sophie. I’m here.” 
[LINE_0314] 
[LINE_0315] “Maman,” Sophie said, her voice almost lost in the pounding on the door. “What if Tante Isabelle is 
[LINE_0316] out there?” 
[LINE_0317] 
[LINE_0318] Vianne stared down at Sophie’s small, earnest face, covered now in a sheen of sweat and dust. “God 
[LINE_0319] help her” was all she could think of to say. 
[LINE_0320] 
[LINE_0321] 
[LINE_0322] 
[LINE_0323] * * * 
[LINE_0324] 
[LINE_0325] At the sight of the gray stone house, Isabelle felt awash in exhaustion. Her shoulders sagged. The 
[LINE_0326] blisters on her feet became unbearable. In front of her, Gaetan opened the gate. She heard it clatter 
[LINE_0327] brokenly and tilt sideways. 
[LINE_0328] 
[LINE_0329] Leaning into him, she stumbled up to the front door. She knocked twice, wincing each time her 
[LINE_0330] bloodied knuckles hit the wood. 
[LINE_0331] 
[LINE_0332] No one answered. 
[LINE_0333] 
[LINE_0334] She pounded with both of her fists, trying to call out her sister’s name, but her voice was too hoarse 
[LINE_0335] to find any volume. 
[LINE_0336] 
[LINE_0337] She staggered back, almost sinking to her knees in defeat. 
[LINE_0338] 
[LINE_0339] “Where can you sleep?” Gaetan said, holding her upright with his hand on her waist. 
[LINE_0340] 
[LINE_0341] “In the back. The pergola.” 
[LINE_0342] 
[LINE_0343] 
[LINE_0344] 
[LINE_0345] 
[LINE_0346] He led her around the house to the backyard. In the lush, jasmine-perfumed shadows of the arbor, 
[LINE_0347] she collapsed to her knees. She hardly noticed that he was gone, and then he was back with some tepid 
[LINE_0348] water, which she gulped from his cupped hands. It wasn’t enough. Her stomach gnarled with hunger, 
[LINE_0349] sent an ache deep, deep inside of her. Still, when he started to leave again, she reached out for him, 
[LINE_0350] mumbled something, a plea not to be left alone, and he sank down beside her, putting out his arm for her 
[LINE_0351] to rest her head upon. They lay side by side in the warm dirt, staring up through the black thicket of 
[LINE_0352] vines that looped around the timbers and cascaded to the ground. The heady aromas of jasmine and 
[LINE_0353] blooming roses and rich earth created a beautiful bower. And yet, even here, in this quiet, it was 
[LINE_0354] impossible to forget what they’d just been through ... and the changes that were close on their heels. 
[LINE_0355] 
[LINE_0356] She had seen a change in Gaetan, watched anger and impotent rage erase the compassion in his eyes 
[LINE_0357] and the smile from his lips. He had hardly spoken since the bombing, and when he did his voice was 
[LINE_0358] clipped and curt. They both knew more about war now, about what was coming. 
[LINE_0359] 
[LINE_0360] “You could be safe here, with your sister,” he said. 
[LINE_0361] 
[LINE_0362] “I don’t want to be safe. And my sister will not want me.”
