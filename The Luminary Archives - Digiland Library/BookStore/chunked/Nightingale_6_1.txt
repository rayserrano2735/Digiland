[LINE_0003] 
[LINE_0004] 
[LINE_0005] The next morning Isabelle blinked awake to see sunlight gilding the leaves rustling overhead. 
[LINE_0006] 
[LINE_0007] She sat up, resmoothing the skirt that had hiked up in her sleep, revealing lacy white garters and 
[LINE_0008] ruined silk stockings. 
[LINE_0009] 
[LINE_0010] “Don’t do that on my account.” 
[LINE_0011] 
[LINE_0012] Isabelle glanced to her left and saw Gaetan coming toward her. For the first time, she saw him 
[LINE_0013] clearly. He was lanky, wiry as an apostrophe mark, and dressed in clothes that appeared to have come 
[LINE_0014] from a beggar’s bin. Beneath a fraying cap, his face was scruffy and sharp, unshaven. He had a wide 
[LINE_0015] brow and a pronounced chin and deep-set gray eyes that were heavily lashed. The look in those eyes 
[LINE_0016] was as sharp as the point of his chin, and revealed a kind of clarified hunger. Last night she’d thought it 
[LINE_0017] was how he’d looked at her. Now she saw that it was how he looked at the world. 
[LINE_0018] 
[LINE_0019] He didn’t scare her, not at all. Isabelle was not like her sister, Vianne, who was given to fear and 
[LINE_0020] anxiety. But neither was Isabelle a fool. If she was going to travel with this man, she had better get a 
[LINE_0021] few things straight. 
[LINE_0022] 
[LINE_0023] “So,” she said. “Prison.” 
[LINE_0024] 
[LINE_0025] He stared at her, raised a black eyebrow, as if to say, Scared yet? “A girl like you wouldn’t know 
[LINE_0026] anything about it. I could tell you it was a Jean Valjean sort of stay and you would think it was 
[LINE_0027] romantic.” 
[LINE_0028] 
[LINE_0029] It was the kind of thing she heard all the time. It circled back to her looks, as most snide comments 
[LINE_0030] did. Surely a pretty blond girl had to be shallow and dim-witted. “Were you stealing food to feed your 
[LINE_0031] family?” 
[LINE_0032] 
[LINE_0033] He grinned crookedly. It gave him a lopsided look, with one side of his smile hiking up farther than 
[LINE_0034] the other. “No.” 
[LINE_0035] 
[LINE_0036] “Are you dangerous?” 
[LINE_0037] 
[LINE_0038] “It depends. What do you think of communists?” 
[LINE_0039] 
[LINE_0040] “Ah. So you were a political prisoner.” 
[LINE_0041] 
[LINE_0042] “Something like that. But like I said, a nice girl like you wouldn’t know anything about survival.” 
[LINE_0043] 
[LINE_0044] “You’d be surprised the things I know, Gaetan. There is more than one kind of prison.” 
[LINE_0045] 
[LINE_0046] “Is there, pretty girl? What do you know about it?” 
[LINE_0047] 
[LINE_0048] 
[LINE_0049] 
[LINE_0050] “What was your crime?” 
[LINE_0051] 
[LINE_0052] “I took things that didn’t belong to me. Is that enough of an answer?” 
[LINE_0053] 
[LINE_0054] Thief. 
[LINE_0055] 
[LINE_0056] “And you got caught.” 
[LINE_0057] 
[LINE_0058] “Obviously.” 
[LINE_0059] 
[LINE_0060] “That isn’t exactly comforting, Gaetan. Were you careless?” 
[LINE_0061] 
[LINE_0062] “Gaet,” he said, moving toward her. 
[LINE_0063] 
[LINE_0064] “I haven’t decided if we’re friends yet.” 
[LINE_0065] 
[LINE_0066] He touched her hair, let a few strands coil around his dirty finger. “We’re friends. Bank on it. Now 
[LINE_0067] let’s go.” 
[LINE_0068] 
[LINE_0069] When he reached for her hand, it occurred to her to refuse him, but she didn’t. They walked out of 
[LINE_0070] the forest and back onto the road, merging once again into the crowd, which opened just enough to let 
[LINE_0071] them in and then closed around them. Isabelle hung on to Gaetan with one hand and held her suitcase in 
[LINE_0072] the other. 
[LINE_0073] 
[LINE_0074] They walked for miles. 
[LINE_0075] 
[LINE_0076] Automobiles died around them. Cartwheels broke. Horses stopped and couldn’t be made to move 
[LINE_0077] again. Isabelle felt herself becoming listless and dull, exhausted by heat and dust and thirst. A woman 
[LINE_0078] limped along beside her, crying, her tears black with dirt and grit, and then that woman was replaced by 
[LINE_0079] an older woman in a fur coat who was sweating profusely and seemed to be wearing every piece of 
[LINE_0080] jewelry she owned. 
[LINE_0081] 
[LINE_0082] The sun grew stronger, became stiflingly, staggeringly hot. Children whined, women whimpered. 
[LINE_0083] The acrid, stuffy scent of body odor and sweat filled the air, but Isabelle had grown so used to it that she 
[LINE_0084] barely noticed other people’s smell or her own. 
[LINE_0085] 
[LINE_0086] It was almost three o’clock, the hottest part of the day, when they saw a regiment of French soldiers 
[LINE_0087] walking alongside them, dragging their rifles. The soldiers moved in a disorganized way, not in 
[LINE_0088] formation, not smartly. A tank rumbled beside them, crunching over belongings left in the road; on it 
[LINE_0089] several whey-faced French soldiers sat slumped, their heads hung low. 
[LINE_0090] 
[LINE_0091] Isabelle pulled free of Gaetan and stumbled through the crowd, elbowing her way to the regiment. 
[LINE_0092] “You’re going the wrong way!” she screamed, surprised to hear how hoarse her voice was. 
[LINE_0093] 
[LINE_0094] Gaetan pounced on a soldier, shoved him back so hard he stumbled and crashed into a slow-moving 
[LINE_0095] tank. “Who is fighting for France?” 
[LINE_0096] 
[LINE_0097] The bleary-eyed soldier shook his head. “No one.” In a glint of silver, Isabelle saw the knife Gaetan 
[LINE_0098] held to the man’s throat. The soldier’s gaze narrowed. “Go ahead. Do it. Kill me.” 
[LINE_0099] 
[LINE_0100] Isabelle pulled Gaetan away. In his eyes, she saw a rage so deep it scared her. He could do it; he 
[LINE_0101] could kill this man by slitting his throat. And she thought: They opened the prisons. Was he worse than 
[LINE_0102] a thief? 
[LINE_0103] 
[LINE_0104] “Gaet?” she said. 
[LINE_0105] 
[LINE_0106] Her voice got through to him. He shook his head as if to clear it and lowered his knife. “Who is 
[LINE_0107] 
[LINE_0108] 
[LINE_0109] 
[LINE_0110] 
[LINE_0111] fighting for us?” he said bitterly, coughing at the dust. 
[LINE_0112] 
[LINE_0113] “We will be,” she said. “Soon.” 
[LINE_0114] 
[LINE_0115] Behind her, an automobile honked its horn. Aah-ooh-gah. Isabelle ignored it. Automobiles were no 
[LINE_0116] better than walking anymore — the few that were still running were moving only at the whim of the 
[LINE_0117] people around them; like flotsam in the reeds of a muddy river. “Come on.” She pulled him away from 
[LINE_0118] the demoralized regiment. 
[LINE_0119] 
[LINE_0120] They walked on, still holding hands, but as the hours passed, Isabelle noticed a change in Gaetan. 
[LINE_0121] He rarely spoke and didn’t smile. 
[LINE_0122] 
[LINE_0123] At each town, the crowd thinned. People stumbled into Artenay, Saran, and Orleans, their eyes 
[LINE_0124] alight with desperation as they reached into handbags and pockets and wallets for money they hoped to 
[LINE_0125] be able to spend. 
[LINE_0126] 
[LINE_0127] Still, Isabelle and Gaetan kept going. They walked all day and fell into exhausted sleep in the dark 
[LINE_0128] and woke again to walk the next day. By their third day, Isabelle was numb with exhaustion. Oozing red 
[LINE_0129] blisters had formed between most of her toes and on the balls of her feet and every step was painful. 
[LINE_0130] Dehydration gave her a terrible, pounding headache and hunger gnawed at her empty stomach. Dust 
[LINE_0131] clogged her throat and eyes and made her cough constantly. 
[LINE_0132] 
[LINE_0133] She stumbled past a freshly dug grave on the side of the road, marked by a crudely hammered- 
[LINE_0134] together wooden cross. Her shoe caught on something — a dead cat — and she staggered forward, almost 
[LINE_0135] falling to her knees. Gaetan steadied her. 
[LINE_0136] 
[LINE_0137] She clung to his hand, remained stubbornly upright. 
[LINE_0138] 
[LINE_0139] How much later was it that she heard something? 
[LINE_0140] 
[LINE_0141] An hour? A day? 
[LINE_0142] 
[LINE_0143] Bees. They buzzed around her head; she batted them away. She licked her dried lips and thought of 
[LINE_0144] pleasant days in the garden, with bees buzzing about. 
[LINE_0145] 
[LINE_0146] No. 
[LINE_0147] 
[LINE_0148] Not bees. 
[LINE_0149] 
[LINE_0150] She knew that sound. 
[LINE_0151] 
[LINE_0152] She stopped, frowning. Her thoughts were addled. What had she been trying to remember? 
[LINE_0153] 
[LINE_0154] The droning grew louder, filling the air, and then the aeroplanes appeared, six or seven of them, 
[LINE_0155] looking like small crucifixes against the blue and cloudless sky. 
[LINE_0156] 
[LINE_0157] Isabelle tented a hand over her eyes, watching the aeroplanes fly closer, lower . . . 
[LINE_0158] 
[LINE_0159] Someone yelled, “It’s the Bodies!” 
[LINE_0160] 
[LINE_0161] In the distance, a stone bridge exploded in a spray of fire and stone and smoke. 
[LINE_0162] 
[LINE_0163] The aeroplanes dropped lower over the crowd. 
[LINE_0164] 
[LINE_0165] Gaetan threw Isabelle to the ground and covered her body with his. The world became pure sound: 
[LINE_0166] the roar of the aeroplane engines, the rat-ta-ta-tat of machine-gun fire, the beat of her heart, people 
[LINE_0167] screaming. Bullets ate up the grass in rows, people screamed and cried out. Isabelle saw a woman fly 
[LINE_0168] into the air like a rag doll and hit the ground in a heap. 
[LINE_0169] 
[LINE_0170] 
[LINE_0171] 
[LINE_0172] 
[LINE_0173] .Jrees snapped in half and fell over, people yelled. Flames burst into existence. Smoke filled the air. 
[LINE_0174] 
[LINE_0175] JMK nd then . . . quiet. 
[LINE_0176] 
[LINE_0177] (1 Gaetan rolled off her. 
[LINE_0178] 
[LINE_0179] “Are you all right?” he asked. 
[LINE_0180] 
[LINE_0181] She pushed the hair from her eyes and sat up. 
[LINE_0182] 
[LINE_0183] There were mangled bodies everywhere, and fires, and billowing black smoke. People were 
[LINE_0184] screaming, crying, dying. 
[LINE_0185] 
[LINE_0186] An old man moaned, “Help me.” 
[LINE_0187] 
[LINE_0188] Isabelle crawled to him on her hands and knees, realizing as she got close that the ground was 
[LINE_0189] marshy with his blood. A stomach wound gaped through his ripped shirt; entrails bulged out of the torn 
[LINE_0190] flesh. 
[LINE_0191] 
[LINE_0192] “Maybe there’s a doctor” was all she could think of to say. And then she heard it again. The droning. 
[LINE_0193] 
[LINE_0194] “They’re coming back.” Gaetan pulled her to her feet. She almost slipped in the blood-soaked grass. 
[LINE_0195] Not far away a bomb hit, exploding into fire. Isabelle saw a toddler in soiled nappies standing by a dead 
[LINE_0196] woman, crying. 
[LINE_0197] 
[LINE_0198] She stumbled toward the toddler. Gaetan yanked her sideways. 
[LINE_0199] 
[LINE_0200] “I have to help — ” 
[LINE_0201] 
[LINE_0202] “Your dying won’t help that kid,” he growled, pulling her so hard it hurt. She stumbled along beside 
[LINE_0203] him in a daze. They dodged discarded automobiles and bodies, most of which were ripped beyond 
[LINE_0204] repair, bleeding, bones sticking out through clothes. 
[LINE_0205] 
[LINE_0206] At the edge of town, Gaetan pulled Isabelle into a small stone church. Others were already there, 
[LINE_0207] crouching in corners, hiding amid the pews, hugging their loved ones close. 
[LINE_0208] 
[LINE_0209] Aeroplanes roared overhead, accompanied by the stuttering shriek of machine guns. The stained- 
[LINE_0210] glass window shattered; bits of colored glass clattered to the floor, slicing through skin on the way 
[LINE_0211] down. Timbers cracked, dust and stones fell. Bullets ran across the church, nailing arms and legs to the 
[LINE_0212] floor. The altar exploded. 
[LINE_0213] 
[LINE_0214] Gaetan said something to her, and she answered, or she thought she did, but she wasn’t sure, and 
[LINE_0215] before she could figure it out, another bomb whistled, fell, and the roof over her head exploded.
