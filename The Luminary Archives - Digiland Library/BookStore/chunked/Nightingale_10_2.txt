[LINE_0376] you get today?” 
[LINE_0377] 
[LINE_0378] “Ham hocks,” Isabelle said, glancing worriedly at the basket in Beck’s hand. 
[LINE_0379] 
[LINE_0380] “That’s all?” Vianne said. “What about the cooking oil?” 
[LINE_0381] 
[LINE_0382] Sophie sank back to the rug on the floor, clearly disappointed. 
[LINE_0383] 
[LINE_0384] “I will put the hocks in the pantry,” Isabelle said, reaching for the basket. 
[LINE_0385] 
[LINE_0386] “Please, allow me,” Beck said. He was staring at Isabelle, watching her closely. Or maybe it only 
[LINE_0387] felt like that. 
[LINE_0388] 
[LINE_0389] Vianne lit a candle and handed it to Isabelle. “Don’t waste it. Hurry.” 
[LINE_0390] 
[LINE_0391] Beck was very gallant as he walked through the shadowy kitchen and opened the door to the cellar. 
[LINE_0392] 
[LINE_0393] Isabelle went down first, lighting the way. The wooden steps creaked beneath her feet until she 
[LINE_0394] stepped down onto the hard-packed dirt floor and into the subterranean chill. The wooden shelves 
[LINE_0395] seemed to close in around them as Beck came up beside her. The candle flame sent light gamboling in 
[LINE_0396] front of them. 
[LINE_0397] 
[LINE_0398] She tried to still the trembling in her hand as she reached for the paper- wrapped ham hocks. She 
[LINE_0399] placed them on the shelf beside their dwindling supplies. 
[LINE_0400] 
[LINE_0401] “Bring up three potatoes and a turnip,” Vianne called down. Isabelle jumped a little at the sound. 
[LINE_0402] 
[LINE_0403] “You seem nervous,” Beck said. “Is that the right word, M’mselle?” 
[LINE_0404] 
[LINE_0405] The candle sputtered between them. “There were a lot of dogs in town today.” 
[LINE_0406] 
[LINE_0407] “The Gestapo. They love their shepherds. There is no reason for this to concern you.” 
[LINE_0408] 
[LINE_0409] “I am afraid ... of big dogs. I was bitten once. As a child.” 
[LINE_0410] 
[LINE_0411] Beck gave her a smile that was stretched out of shape by the light. 
[LINE_0412] 
[LINE_0413] Don’t look at the basket. But it was too late. She saw a little more of the hidden papers sticking out. 
[LINE_0414] 
[LINE_0415] She forced a smile. “You know us girls. Scared of everything.” 
[LINE_0416] 
[LINE_0417] “That is not how I would describe you, M’mselle.” 
[LINE_0418] 
[LINE_0419] She reached carefully for the basket and tugged it from his grasp. Without breaking eye contact, she 
[LINE_0420] set the basket on the shelf, beyond the candle’s light. When it was there, in the dark, she finally released 
[LINE_0421] her breath. 
[LINE_0422] 
[LINE_0423] They stared at each other in uncomfortable silence. 
[LINE_0424] 
[LINE_0425] Beck nodded. “And now I must away. I have only come here to pick up some papers for a meeting 
[LINE_0426] tonight.” He turned back for the steps and began climbing them. 
[LINE_0427] 
[LINE_0428] Isabelle followed the captain up the narrow stairs. When she emerged into the kitchen, Vianne was 
[LINE_0429] 
[LINE_0430] 
[LINE_0431] 
[LINE_0432] 
[LINE_0433] standing there with her arms crossed, frowning. 
[LINE_0434] 
[LINE_0435] “Where are the potatoes and a turnip?” Vianne asked. 
[LINE_0436] 
[LINE_0437] “I forgot.” 
[LINE_0438] 
[LINE_0439] Vianne sighed. “Go,” she said. “Get them.” 
[LINE_0440] 
[LINE_0441] Isabelle turned and went back into the cellar. After she’d gathered up the potatoes and turnip, she 
[LINE_0442] went to the basket, lifted the candle to expose the basket to light. There it was: the tiny white triangle of 
[LINE_0443] paper, peeking out. She quickly withdrew the papers from the basket and shoved them into her panty 
[LINE_0444] girdle. Feeling the papers against her skin, she went upstairs, smiling. 
[LINE_0445] 
[LINE_0446] * * * 
[LINE_0447] 
[LINE_0448] At supper, Isabelle sat with her sister and niece, eating watery soup and day-old bread, trying to think of 
[LINE_0449] something to say, but nothing came to her. Sophie, who seemed not to notice, rambled on, telling one 
[LINE_0450] story after another. Isabelle tapped her foot nervously, listening for the sound of a motorcycle 
[LINE_0451] approaching the house, for the clatter of German jackboots on the walkway out front, for a sharp, 
[LINE_0452] impersonal knock on the door. Her gaze kept cutting to the kitchen and the cellar door. 
[LINE_0453] 
[LINE_0454] “You are acting strangely tonight,” Vianne said. 
[LINE_0455] 
[LINE_0456] Isabelle ignored her sister’s observation. When the meal was finally over, Isabelle popped out of her 
[LINE_0457] seat and said, “I’ll do the dishes, V. Why don’t you and Sophie finish your game of checkers?” 
[LINE_0458] 
[LINE_0459] “You’ll do dishes?” Vianne said, giving Isabelle a suspicious look. 
[LINE_0460] 
[LINE_0461] “Come on, I’ve offered before,” Isabelle said. 
[LINE_0462] 
[LINE_0463] “Not in my memory.” 
[LINE_0464] 
[LINE_0465] Isabelle gathered the empty soup bowls and utensils. She had offered only to keep busy, to do 
[LINE_0466] something with her hands. 
[LINE_0467] 
[LINE_0468] Afterward, Isabelle could find nothing to do. The night dragged on. Vianne and Sophie and Isabelle 
[LINE_0469] played Belote, but Isabelle couldn’t concentrate, she was so nervous and excited. She made some lame 
[LINE_0470] excuse and quit the game early, pretending to be tired. In her upstairs bedroom, she lay atop the 
[LINE_0471] blankets, fully dressed. Waiting. 
[LINE_0472] 
[LINE_0473] It was past midnight when she heard Beck return. She heard him enter the yard; then she smelled the 
[LINE_0474] smoke from his cigarette drift up. Later, he came into the house — clomping around in his boots — but by 
[LINE_0475] one o’clock everything was quiet again. Still she waited. At four a.m., she got out of bed and dressed in 
[LINE_0476] a heavy worsted knit black sweater and plaid tweed skirt. She ripped a seam open in her summer-weight 
[LINE_0477] coat and slid the papers inside, then she put the coat on, tying the belt at her waist. She slipped the 
[LINE_0478] ration cards in her front pocket. 
[LINE_0479] 
[LINE_0480] On the way downstairs, she winced at every creak of sound. It seemed to take forever to get to the 
[LINE_0481] front door, more than forever, but finally she was there, opening it quietly, closing it behind her. 
[LINE_0482] 
[LINE_0483] The early morning was cold and black. Somewhere a bird called out, his slumber probably disturbed 
[LINE_0484] by the opening of the door. She breathed in the scent of roses and was overcome by how ordinary it 
[LINE_0485] seemed in this moment. 
[LINE_0486] 
[LINE_0487] 
[LINE_0488] 
[LINE_0489] 
[LINE_0490] From here there would be no turning back. 
[LINE_0491] 
[LINE_0492] She walked to the still-broken gate, glancing back often at the blacked-out house, expecting Beck to 
[LINE_0493] be there, arms crossed, booted feet in a warrior’s stance, watching her. 
[LINE_0494] 
[LINE_0495] But she was alone. 
[LINE_0496] 
[LINE_0497] Her first stop was Rachel’s house. There were almost no mail deliveries these days, but women like 
[LINE_0498] Rachel, whose men were gone, checked their letter boxes each day, hoping against hope that the mail 
[LINE_0499] would bring them news. 
[LINE_0500] 
[LINE_0501] Isabelle reached inside her coat, felt for the slit in the silk lining, and pulled out a single piece of 
[LINE_0502] paper. In one movement, she opened the letterbox and slid the paper inside and quietly shut the lid. 
[LINE_0503] 
[LINE_0504] Out on the road again, she looked around and saw no one. 
[LINE_0505] 
[LINE_0506] She had done it! 
[LINE_0507] 
[LINE_0508] Her second stop was old man Rivet’s farm. He was a communist through and through, a man of the 
[LINE_0509] revolution, and he’d lost a son at the front. 
[LINE_0510] 
[LINE_0511] By the time she gave away her last tract, she felt invincible. It was just past dawn; pale sunlight 
[LINE_0512] gilded the limestone buildings in town. 
[LINE_0513] 
[LINE_0514] She was the first woman to queue up outside the shop this morning, and because of that, she got her 
[LINE_0515] full ration of butter. One hundred fifty grams for the month. Two-thirds of a cup. 
[LINE_0516] 
[LINE_0517] A treasure.
