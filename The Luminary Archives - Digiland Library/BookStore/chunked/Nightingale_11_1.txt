[LINE_0001] ELEVEN 
[LINE_0002] 
[LINE_0003] 
[LINE_0004] 
[LINE_0005] Every day that long, hot summer, Vianne woke to a list of chores. She (along with Sophie and Isabelle) 
[LINE_0006] replanted and expanded the garden and converted a pair of old bookcases into rabbit hutches. She used 
[LINE_0007] chicken wire to enclose the pergola. Now the most romantic place on the property stank of manure — 
[LINE_0008] manure they collected for their garden. She took in wash from the farmer down the road — old man 
[LINE_0009] Rivet — in exchange for feed. The only time she really relaxed, and felt like herself, was on Sunday 
[LINE_0010] mornings, when she took Sophie to church (Isabelle refused to attend Mass) and then had coffee with 
[LINE_0011] Rachel, sitting in the shade of her backyard, just two best friends talking, laughing, joking. Sometimes 
[LINE_0012] Isabelle joined them, but she was more likely to play with the children than talk with the women — 
[LINE_0013] which was fine with Vianne. 
[LINE_0014] 
[LINE_0015] Her chores were necessary, of course — a new way of preparing for a winter that seemed far away 
[LINE_0016] but would arrive like an unwanted guest on the worst possible day. More important, it kept Vianne ’s 
[LINE_0017] mind occupied. When she was working in her garden or boiling strawberries for preserves or pickling 
[LINE_0018] cucumbers, she wasn’t thinking of Antoine and how long it had been since she’d heard from him. It was 
[LINE_0019] the uncertainty that gnawed at her: Was he a prisoner of war? Was he wounded somewhere? Dead? Or 
[LINE_0020] would she look up one day and see him walking up this road, smiling? 
[LINE_0021] 
[LINE_0022] Missing him. Longing for him. Worrying about him. Those were her nighttime journeys. 
[LINE_0023] 
[LINE_0024] In a world now laden with bad news and silence, the one bit of good news was that Captain Beck 
[LINE_0025] had spent much of the summer away on one campaign or another. In his absence, the household settled 
[LINE_0026] into a routine of sorts. Isabelle did all that was asked of her without complaint. 
[LINE_0027] 
[LINE_0028] It was October now, and chilly. Vianne found herself distracted as she walked home from school 
[LINE_0029] with Sophie. She could feel that one of her heels was coming loose; it made her slightly unsteady. Her 
[LINE_0030] black kidskin oxfords weren’t made for the kind of everyday use to which they’d been put in the past 
[LINE_0031] few months. The sole was beginning to pull away at the toe, which often caused her to trip. The worry 
[LINE_0032] about replacing things like shoes was never far away. A ration card did not mean there were shoes — or 
[LINE_0033] food — to be bought. 
[LINE_0034] 
[LINE_0035] Vianne kept one hand on Sophie’s shoulder, both to steady her gait and to keep her daughter close. 
[LINE_0036] There were Nazi soldiers everywhere; riding in lorries and on motorcycles with machine-gun-mounted 
[LINE_0037] sidecars. They marched in the square, their voices raised in triumphant song. 
[LINE_0038] 
[LINE_0039] 
[LINE_0040] 
[LINE_0041] A military lorry honked at them and they moved farther onto the sidewalk as a convoy rumbled past. 
[LINE_0042] More Nazis. 
[LINE_0043] 
[LINE_0044] “Is that Tante Isabelle?” Sophie asked. 
[LINE_0045] 
[LINE_0046] Vianne glanced in the direction of Sophie’s finger. Sure enough, Isabelle was coming out of an alley, 
[LINE_0047] clutching her basket. She looked . . . “furtive” was the only word that came to mind. 
[LINE_0048] 
[LINE_0049] Furtive. At that, a dozen little pieces clicked into place. Tiny incongruities became a pattern. Isabelle 
[LINE_0050] had often left Le Jardin in the wee hours of the morning, much earlier than necessary. She had dozens of 
[LINE_0051] long-winded excuses for absences that Vianne had barely cared about. Heels that broke, hats that flew 
[LINE_0052] off in the wind and had to be chased down, a dog that frightened her and blocked her way. 
[LINE_0053] 
[LINE_0054] Was she sneaking out to be with a boy? 
[LINE_0055] 
[LINE_0056] “Tante Isabelle!” Sophie cried out. 
[LINE_0057] 
[LINE_0058] Without waiting for a reply — or permission — Sophie darted into the street. She dodged a trio of 
[LINE_0059] German soldiers who were tossing a ball back and forth. 
[LINE_0060] 
[LINE_0061] “Merde, ” Vianne muttered. “Pardon,” she said, ducking around the soldiers and striding across the 
[LINE_0062] cobblestoned street. 
[LINE_0063] 
[LINE_0064] “What did you get today?” she heard Sophie ask Isabelle as her daughter reached into the willow 
[LINE_0065] basket. 
[LINE_0066] 
[LINE_0067] Isabelle slapped Sophie’s hand. Hard. 
[LINE_0068] 
[LINE_0069] Sophie yelped and drew her hand back. 
[LINE_0070] 
[LINE_0071] “Isabelle!” Vianne said harshly. “What’s wrong with you?” 
[LINE_0072] 
[LINE_0073] Isabelle had the good grace to blush. “I am sorry. It’s just that I’m tired. I have been in queues all 
[LINE_0074] day. And for what? A veal jelly bone with barely any meat on it and a tin of milk. It’s disheartening. 
[LINE_0075] Still, I shouldn’t be rude. I’m sorry, Soph.” 
[LINE_0076] 
[LINE_0077] “Perhaps if you didn’t sneak out so early in the morning you wouldn’t be tired,” Vianne said. 
[LINE_0078] 
[LINE_0079] “I’m not sneaking out,” Isabelle said. “I’m going to the shops for food. I thought you wanted that of 
[LINE_0080] me. And by the way, we need a bicycle. These walks to town on bad shoes are killing me.” 
[LINE_0081] 
[LINE_0082] Vianne wished she knew her sister well enough to read the look in her eyes. Was it guilt? Or worry 
[LINE_0083] or defiance? If she didn’t know better, she’d say it was pride. 
[LINE_0084] 
[LINE_0085] Sophie linked arms with Isabelle as the three of them set off for home. 
[LINE_0086] 
[LINE_0087] Vianne studiously ignored the changes to Carriveau — the Nazis taking up so much space, the posters 
[LINE_0088] on the limestone walls (the new anti-Jewish tracts were sickening), and the red and black swastika flags 
[LINE_0089] hanging above doorways and from balconies. People had begun to leave Carriveau, abandoning their 
[LINE_0090] homes to the Germans. The rumor was that they were going to the Free Zone, but no one knew for sure. 
[LINE_0091] Shops closed and didn’t reopen. 
[LINE_0092] 
[LINE_0093] She heard footsteps coming up behind her and said evenly, “Let’s walk faster.” 
[LINE_0094] 
[LINE_0095] “Madame Mauriac, if I may interrupt.” 
[LINE_0096] 
[LINE_0097] “Good Lord, is he following you?” Isabelle muttered. 
[LINE_0098] 
[LINE_0099] Vianne slowly turned around. “Herr Captain,” she said. People in the street watched Vianne closely, 
[LINE_0100] 
[LINE_0101] 
[LINE_0102] 
[LINE_0103] 
[LINE_0104] eyes narrowed in disapproval. 
[LINE_0105] 
[LINE_0106] “I wanted to say that I will be late tonight and will, sorrowfully, not be there for supper,” Beck said. 
[LINE_0107] 
[LINE_0108] “How terrible,” Isabelle said in a voice as sweet and bitter as burned caramel. 
[LINE_0109] 
[LINE_0110] Vianne tried to smile, but really, she didn’t know why he’d stopped her. “I will save you something 
[LINE_0111] 
[LINE_0112] 55 
[LINE_0113] 
[LINE_0114] “Nein. Nein. You are most kind.” He fell silent. 
[LINE_0115] 
[LINE_0116] Vianne did the same. 
[LINE_0117] 
[LINE_0118] Finally Isabelle sighed heavily. “We are on our way home, Herr Captain.” 
[LINE_0119] 
[LINE_0120] “Is there something I can do for you, Herr Captain?” said Vianne. 
[LINE_0121] 
[LINE_0122] Beck moved closer. “I know how worried you have been about your husband, so I did some 
[LINE_0123] checking.” 
[LINE_0124] 
[LINE_0125] “Oh.” 
[LINE_0126] 
[LINE_0127] “It is not fine news, I am sorrowful to report. Your husband, Antoine Mauriac, has been captured 
[LINE_0128] along with many of your town’s men. He is in a prisoner of war camp.” He handed her a list of names 
[LINE_0129] and a stack of official postcards. “He will not be coming home.” 
[LINE_0130] 
[LINE_0131] * * * 
[LINE_0132] 
[LINE_0133] Vianne barely remembered leaving town. She knew Isabelle was beside her, holding her upright, urging 
[LINE_0134] her to put one foot in front of the other, and that Sophie was beside her, chirping out questions as sharp 
[LINE_0135] as fish hooks. What is a prisoner of war? What did Herr Captain mean that Papa would not be coming 
[LINE_0136] home? Never? 
[LINE_0137] 
[LINE_0138] Vianne knew when they’d arrived home because the scents of her garden greeted her, welcomed her. 
[LINE_0139] She blinked, feeling a little like someone who had just wakened from a coma to find the world 
[LINE_0140] impossibly changed. 
[LINE_0141] 
[LINE_0142] “Sophie,” Isabelle said firmly. “Go make your mother a cup of coffee. Open a tin of milk.” 
[LINE_0143] 
[LINE_0144] “But—” 
[LINE_0145] 
[LINE_0146] “Go,” Isabelle said. 
[LINE_0147] 
[LINE_0148] When Sophie was gone, Isabelle turned to Vianne, cupped her face with cold hands. “He’ll be all 
[LINE_0149] right.” 
[LINE_0150] 
[LINE_0151] Vianne felt as if she were breaking apart bit by bit, losing blood and bone as she stood here, 
[LINE_0152] contemplating something she had studiously avoided thinking about: a life without him. She started to 
[LINE_0153] shiver; her teeth chattered. 
[LINE_0154] 
[LINE_0155] “Come inside for coffee,” Isabelle said. 
[LINE_0156] 
[LINE_0157] Into the house? Their house? His ghost would be everywhere in there — a dent in the divan where he 
[LINE_0158] sat to read, the hook that held his coat. And the bed. 
[LINE_0159] 
[LINE_0160] She shook her head, wishing she could cry, but there were no tears in her. This news had emptied 
[LINE_0161] her. She couldn’t even breathe. 
[LINE_0162] 
[LINE_0163] Suddenly all she could think about was the sweater of his that she was wearing. She started to strip 
[LINE_0164] 
[LINE_0165] 
[LINE_0166] 
[LINE_0167] 
[LINE_0168] out of her clothes, tearing off the coat and the vest — ignoring Isabelle’s shouted NO ! — as she yanked 
[LINE_0169] the sweater over her head and buried her face in the soft wool, trying to smell him in the yarn — his 
[LINE_0170] favorite soap, him. 
[LINE_0171] 
[LINE_0172] But there was nothing but her own smell. She lowered the bunched-up sweater from her face and 
[LINE_0173] stared down at it, trying to remember the last time he’d worn it. She picked at a loose thread and it 
[LINE_0174] unraveled in her hand, became a squiggly coil of wine-colored yarn. She bit it off and tied a knot to save 
[LINE_0175] the rest of the sleeve. Yarn was precious these days. 
[LINE_0176] 
[LINE_0177] These days. 
[LINE_0178] 
[LINE_0179] When the world was at war and everything was scarce and your husband was gone. “I don’t know 
[LINE_0180] how to be on my own.” 
[LINE_0181] 
[LINE_0182] “What do you mean? We were on our own for years. From the moment Maman died.” 
[LINE_0183] 
[LINE_0184] Vianne blinked. Her sister’s words sounded a little jumbled, as if they were running on the wrong 
[LINE_0185] speed. “You were alone,” she said. “I never was. I met Antoine when I was fourteen and got pregnant at 
[LINE_0186] sixteen and married him when I was barely seventeen. Papa gave me this house to get rid of me. So, you 
[LINE_0187] see, I’ve never been on my own. That’s why you’re so strong and I’m not.” 
[LINE_0188] 
[LINE_0189] “You will have to be,” Isabelle said. “For Sophie.” 
[LINE_0190] 
[LINE_0191] Vianne drew in a breath. And there it was. The reason she couldn’t eat a bowl of arsenic or throw 
[LINE_0192] herself in front of a train. She took the short coil of crooked yarn and tied it to an apple tree branch. The 
[LINE_0193] burgundy color stood out against the green and brown. Now, each day in her garden and when she 
[LINE_0194] walked to her gate and when she picked apples, she would pass this branch and see this bit of yarn and 
[LINE_0195] think of Antoine. Each time she would pray — to him and to God — Come home. 
[LINE_0196] 
[LINE_0197] “Come,” Isabelle said, putting an arm around Vianne, pulling her close. 
[LINE_0198] 
[LINE_0199] Inside, the house echoed the voice of a man who wasn’t there. 
[LINE_0200] 
[LINE_0201] * * * 
[LINE_0202] 
[LINE_0203] Vianne stood outside Rachel’s stone cottage; overhead the sky was the color of smoke on this cold, late 
[LINE_0204] afternoon. The leaves of the trees, marigold and tangerine and scarlet, were just beginning to darken 
[LINE_0205] around the edges. Soon they would drop to the ground. 
[LINE_0206] 
[LINE_0207] Vianne stared at the door, wishing she didn’t need to be here, but she had read the names Beck had 
[LINE_0208] given her. Marc de Champlain was also listed. 
[LINE_0209] 
[LINE_0210] When she finally found the courage to knock, Rachel answered almost instantly, wearing an old 
[LINE_0211] housedress and sagging woolen stockings. A cardigan sweater hung askew, buttoned incorrectly. It gave 
[LINE_0212] her an odd, tilted look. 
[LINE_0213] 
[LINE_0214] “Vianne! Come in. Sarah and I were just making a rice pudding — it’s mostly water and gelatin, of 
[LINE_0215] course, but I used a bit of milk.” 
[LINE_0216] 
[LINE_0217] Vianne managed a smile. She let her friend sweep her into the kitchen and pour her a cup of the 
[LINE_0218] bitter, ersatz coffee that was all they could get. Vianne was remarking on the rice pudding — what she 
[LINE_0219] even said she didn’t know — when Rachel turned and asked, “What’s wrong?” 
[LINE_0220] 
[LINE_0221] 
[LINE_0222] 
[LINE_0223] 
[LINE_0224] Vianne stared at her friend. She wanted to be the strong one — for once — but she couldn’t stop the 
[LINE_0225] tears that filled her eyes. 
[LINE_0226] 
[LINE_0227] “Stay in the kitchen,” Rachel said to Sarah. “If you hear your brother wake up, get him. You,” she 
[LINE_0228] said to Vianne, “come with me.” She took Vianne by the arm and guided her through the small salon 
[LINE_0229] and into Rachel’s bedroom. 
[LINE_0230] 
[LINE_0231] Vianne sat on the bed and looked up at her friend. Silently, she held out the list of names she’d 
[LINE_0232] gotten from Beck. “They’re prisoners of war, Rachel. Antoine and Marc and all the others. They won’t 
[LINE_0233] be coming home.” 
[LINE_0234] 
[LINE_0235] 
[LINE_0236] 
[LINE_0237] * * * 
[LINE_0238] 
[LINE_0239] Three days later, on a frosty Saturday morning, Vianne stood in her classroom and stared out at the 
[LINE_0240] group of women seated in desks that were too small for them. They looked tired and a little wary. No 
[LINE_0241] one felt comfortable gathering these days. It was never clear exactly how far verboten extended into 
[LINE_0242] conversations about the war, and besides that, the women of Carriveau were exhausted. They spent their 
[LINE_0243] days standing in line for insufficient quantities of foods, and when they weren’t in line, they were 
[LINE_0244] foraging the countryside or trying to sell their dancing shoes or a silk scarf for enough money to buy a 
[LINE_0245] loaf of good bread. In the back of the room, tucked into the corner, Sophie and Sarah were leaning 
[LINE_0246] against each other, knees drawn up, reading books. 
[LINE_0247] 
[LINE_0248] Rachel moved her sleeping son from one shoulder to the other and closed the door of the classroom. 
[LINE_0249] “Thank you all for coming. I know how difficult it is these days to do anything more than the absolutely 
[LINE_0250] necessary.” There was a murmuring of agreement among the women. 
[LINE_0251] 
[LINE_0252] “Why are we here?” Madame Fournier asked tiredly. 
[LINE_0253] 
[LINE_0254] Vianne stepped forward. She had never felt completely comfortable around some of the women, 
[LINE_0255] many of whom had disliked Vianne when she moved here at fourteen. When Vianne had “caught” 
[LINE_0256] Antoine — the best-looking young man in town — they’d liked her even less. Those days were long past, 
[LINE_0257] of course, and now Vianne was friendly with these women and taught their children and frequented their 
[LINE_0258] shops, but even so, the pains of adolescence left a residue of discomfort. “I have received a list of 
[LINE_0259] French prisoners of war from Carriveau. I am sorry — terribly sorry — to tell you that your husbands — 
[LINE_0260] and mine, and Rachel’s — are on the list. I am told they will not be coming home.” 
[LINE_0261] 
[LINE_0262] She paused, allowing the women to react. Grief and loss transformed the faces around her. Vianne 
[LINE_0263] knew the pain mirrored her own. Even so, it was difficult to watch, and she found her eyes misting 
[LINE_0264] again. Rachel stepped close, took her hand. 
[LINE_0265] 
[LINE_0266] “I got us postcards,” Vianne said. “Official ones. So we can write to our men.” 
[LINE_0267] 
[LINE_0268] “How did you get so many postcards?” Madame Fournier asked, wiping her eyes. 
[LINE_0269] 
[LINE_0270] “She asked her German for a favor,” said Helene Ruelle, the baker’s wife. 
[LINE_0271] 
[LINE_0272] “I did not! And he’s not my German,” Vianne said. “He is a soldier who has requisitioned my home. 
[LINE_0273] Should I just let the Germans have Le Jardin? Just walk away and have nothing? Every house or hotel in 
[LINE_0274] town with a spare room has been taken by them. I am not special in this.” 
[LINE_0275] 
[LINE_0276] 
[LINE_0277] 
[LINE_0278] 
[LINE_0279] More tsking and murmurs. Some women nodded; others shook their heads. 
[LINE_0280] 
[LINE_0281] “I would have killed myself before I let one of them move into my house,” Helene said. 
[LINE_0282] 
[LINE_0283] “Would you, Helene? Would you really?” Vianne said. “And would you kill your children first or 
[LINE_0284] throw them out into the street to survive on their own?” 
[LINE_0285] 
[LINE_0286] Helene looked away. 
[LINE_0287] 
[LINE_0288] “They have taken over my hotel,” a woman said. “And they are gentlemen, for the most part. A bit 
[LINE_0289] crude, perhaps. Wasteful.” 
[LINE_0290] 
[LINE_0291] “Gentlemen.” Helene spat the word. “We are pigs to slaughter. You will see. Pigs who put up no 
[LINE_0292] fight at all.” 
[LINE_0293] 
[LINE_0294] “I haven’t seen you at my butcher shop recently,” Madame Fournier said to Vianne in a judgmental 
[LINE_0295] voice. 
[LINE_0296] 
[LINE_0297] “My sister goes for me,” Vianne said. She knew this was the point of their disapproval; they were 
[LINE_0298] afraid that Vianne would get — and take — special privileges that they would be denied. “I would not take 
[LINE_0299] food — or anything — from the enemy.” She felt suddenly as if she were back in school, being bullied by 
[LINE_0300] the popular girls. 
[LINE_0301] 
[LINE_0302] “Vianne is trying to help,” Rachel said sternly enough to shut them up. She took the postcards from 
[LINE_0303] Vianne and began handing them out. 
[LINE_0304] 
[LINE_0305] Vianne took a seat and stared down at her own blank postcard. 
[LINE_0306] 
[LINE_0307] She heard the chicken-scratching of other pencils on other postcards and slowly, she began to write. 
[LINE_0308] My beloved Antoine, 
[LINE_0309] 
[LINE_0310] We are well. Sophie is thriving, and even with 
[LINE_0311] so many chores, we found some time 
[LINE_0312] this summer to spend by the river. We — I — think 
[LINE_0313] of you with every breath and pray 
[LINE_0314] you are well. Do not worry about us, 
[LINE_0315] and come home. 
[LINE_0316] 
[LINE_0317] Je t’aime, Antoine. 
[LINE_0318] 
[LINE_0319] Her lettering was so small she wondered if he would even be able to read it. 
[LINE_0320] 
[LINE_0321] Or if he would get it. 
[LINE_0322] 
[LINE_0323] Or if he was alive. 
[LINE_0324] 
[LINE_0325] For God’s sake, she was crying. 
[LINE_0326] 
[LINE_0327] Rachel moved in beside her, laid a hand on her shoulder. “We all feel it,” she said quietly. 
[LINE_0328] 
[LINE_0329] Moments later, the women rose one by one. Wordlessly, they shuffled forward and gave Vianne their 
[LINE_0330] postcards. 
[LINE_0331] 
[LINE_0332] “Don’t let them hurt your feelings,” Rachel said. “They’re just scared.” 
[LINE_0333] 
[LINE_0334] “I’m scared, too,” Vianne said. 
[LINE_0335] 
[LINE_0336] Rachel pressed her postcard to her chest, her fingers splayed across the small square of paper as if 
[LINE_0337] 
[LINE_0338] 
[LINE_0339] 
[LINE_0340] 
[LINE_0341] she needed to touch each corner. “How can we not be?” 
[LINE_0342] 
[LINE_0343] 
[LINE_0344] 
[LINE_0345] * * * 
[LINE_0346] 
[LINE_0347] Afterward, when they returned to Le Jardin, Beck’s motorcycle with the machine-gun-mounted sidecar 
[LINE_0348] was parked in the grass outside the gate. 
[LINE_0349] 
[LINE_0350] Rachel turned to her. “Do you want us to come in with you?” 
[LINE_0351] 
[LINE_0352] Vianne appreciated the worry in Rachel’s gaze, and she knew that if she asked for help she would 
[LINE_0353] get it, but how was she to be helped? 
[LINE_0354] 
[LINE_0355] “No, merci. We are fine. He has probably forgotten something and will soon leave again. He is 
[LINE_0356] rarely here these days.” 
[LINE_0357] 
[LINE_0358] “Where is Isabelle?” 
[LINE_0359] 
[LINE_0360] “A good question. She sneaks out every Friday morning before the sunrise.” She leaned closer, 
[LINE_0361] whispered, “I think she is meeting a boy.” 
[LINE_0362] 
[LINE_0363] “Good for her.” 
[LINE_0364] 
[LINE_0365] To that, Vianne had no answer. 
[LINE_0366] 
[LINE_0367] “Will he mail the postcards for us?” Rachel asked. 
[LINE_0368] 
[LINE_0369] “I hope so.” Vianne stared at her friend a moment longer. Then she said, “Well, we will know soon 
[LINE_0370] enough,” and led Sophie into the house. Once inside, she instructed Sophie to go upstairs to read. Her 
[LINE_0371] daughter was used to such directives, and she didn’t mind. Vianne tried to keep her daughter and Beck 
[LINE_0372] separated as much as possible. 
[LINE_0373] 
[LINE_0374] He was seated at the dining room table with papers spread out in front of him. At her entrance, he 
[LINE_0375] looked up. A drop of ink fell from the tip of his fountain pen, landed in a blue starburst on the white
