[LINE_0002] 
[LINE_0003] 
[LINE_0004] 
[LINE_0005] Vianne closed her eyes and thought, Hurry home, Antoine. 
[LINE_0006] 
[LINE_0007] It was all she allowed herself, just that one small plea. How could she handle all of this — war, and 
[LINE_0008] Captain Beck, and Isabelle — alone? 
[LINE_0009] 
[LINE_0010] She wanted to daydream, pretend that her world was upright instead of fallen on its side; that the 
[LINE_0011] closed guest room door meant nothing, that Sophie had slept with Vianne last night because they’d 
[LINE_0012] fallen asleep reading, that Antoine was outside on this dewy dawn morning, chopping wood for a winter 
[LINE_0013] that was still months away. Soon he would come in and say, Well, I am off to a day of delivering mail. 
[LINE_0014] Perhaps he would tell her of his latest postmark — a letter in from Africa or America — and he would 
[LINE_0015] spin her a romantically imagined tale to go along with it. 
[LINE_0016] 
[LINE_0017] Instead, she returned her knitting to the basket by the divan, put on her boots, and went outside to 
[LINE_0018] chop wood. It would be autumn again in no time, and then winter, and the devastation of her garden by 
[LINE_0019] the refugees had reminded her how perilously balanced her survival was. She lifted the axe and brought 
[LINE_0020] it down, hard. 
[LINE_0021] 
[LINE_0022] Grasp. Raise. Steady. Chop. 
[LINE_0023] 
[LINE_0024] Every chop reverberated up her arms and lodged painfully in the muscles of her shoulders. Sweat 
[LINE_0025] squeezed from her pores, dampened her hair. 
[LINE_0026] 
[LINE_0027] “Allow me please to do this for you.” 
[LINE_0028] 
[LINE_0029] She froze, the axe in midair. 
[LINE_0030] 
[LINE_0031] Beck stood nearby, dressed in his breeches and boots, with only a thin white T-shirt covering his 
[LINE_0032] chest. His pale cheeks were reddened from a morning shave and his blond hair was wet. Droplets fell 
[LINE_0033] onto his T-shirt, making a pattern of small gray sunbursts. 
[LINE_0034] 
[LINE_0035] She felt acutely uncomfortable in her robe and work boots, with her hair pinned in curls. She 
[LINE_0036] lowered the axe. 
[LINE_0037] 
[LINE_0038] “There are some things a man does around the house. You are much too fragile to chop wood.” 
[LINE_0039] 
[LINE_0040] “I can do it.” 
[LINE_0041] 
[LINE_0042] “Of course you can, but why should you? Go, Madame. See to your daughter. I can do this small 
[LINE_0043] thing for you. Otherwise my mother will beat me with a switch.” 
[LINE_0044] 
[LINE_0045] She meant to move, but somehow she didn’t, and then he was there, pulling the axe gently out of her 
[LINE_0046] 
[LINE_0047] 
[LINE_0048] 
[LINE_0049] hand. She held on instinctively for a moment. 
[LINE_0050] 
[LINE_0051] Their gazes met, held. 
[LINE_0052] 
[LINE_0053] She released her hold and stepped back so quickly she stumbled. He caught her by the wrist, 
[LINE_0054] steadied her. Mumbling a thank-you, she turned and walked away from him, keeping her spine as 
[LINE_0055] straight as she could. It took all of her limited courage not to speed up. Even so, by the time she reached 
[LINE_0056] her door, she felt as if she’d run from Paris. She kicked free of the oversized gardening boots, saw them 
[LINE_0057] hit the house with a thunk and fall in a heap. The last thing she wanted was kindness from this man who 
[LINE_0058] had invaded her home. 
[LINE_0059] 
[LINE_0060] She slammed the door shut behind her and went to the kitchen, where she lit the stove and put a pot 
[LINE_0061] of water on to boil. Then she went to the bottom of the stairs and called her daughter down to breakfast. 
[LINE_0062] 
[LINE_0063] She had to call two more times — and then threaten — before Sophie came trudging down the stairs, 
[LINE_0064] her hair a mess, the look in her eyes sullen. She was wearing her sailor dress — again. In the ten months 
[LINE_0065] Antoine had been gone, she’d outgrown it, but she refused to stop wearing it. “I’m up,” she said, 
[LINE_0066] shuffling to the table, taking her seat. 
[LINE_0067] 
[LINE_0068] Vianne placed a bowl of cornmeal mush in front of her daughter. She had splurged this morning and 
[LINE_0069] added a tablespoon of preserved peaches on top. 
[LINE_0070] 
[LINE_0071] “Maman? Can’t you hear that? There’s someone knocking at the door.” 
[LINE_0072] 
[LINE_0073] Vianne shook her head (all she’d heard was the thunk-thunk-thunk of the axe) and went to the door, 
[LINE_0074] opening it. 
[LINE_0075] 
[LINE_0076] Rachel stood there, with the baby in her arms and Sarah tucked in close to her side. “You are 
[LINE_0077] teaching today with your hair pinned?” 
[LINE_0078] 
[LINE_0079] “Oh!” Vianne felt like a fool. What was wrong with her? Today was the last day of school before the 
[LINE_0080] summer break. “Let’s go, Sophie. We are late.” She rushed back inside and cleared the table. Sophie had 
[LINE_0081] licked her plate clean, so Vianne laid it in the copper sink to wash later. She covered the leftover pot of 
[LINE_0082] mush and put the preserved peaches away. Then she ran upstairs to get ready. 
[LINE_0083] 
[LINE_0084] In no time, she had removed her hairpins and combed her hair into smooth waves. She grabbed her 
[LINE_0085] hat, gloves, and handbag and left the house to find Rachel and the children waiting in the orchard. 
[LINE_0086] 
[LINE_0087] Captain Beck was there, too, standing by the shed. His white T-shirt was soaked in places and clung 
[LINE_0088] to his chest, revealing the whorls of hair beneath. He had the axe slung casually against one shoulder. 
[LINE_0089] 
[LINE_0090] “Ah, greetings,” he said. 
[LINE_0091] 
[LINE_0092] Vianne could feel Rachel’s scrutiny. 
[LINE_0093] 
[LINE_0094] Beck lowered the axe. “This is a friend of yours, Madame?” 
[LINE_0095] 
[LINE_0096] “Rachel,” Vianne said tightly. “My neighbor. This is Herr Captain Beck. He is ... the one billeting 
[LINE_0097] with us.” 
[LINE_0098] 
[LINE_0099] “Greetings,” Beck said again, nodding politely. 
[LINE_0100] 
[LINE_0101] Vianne put a hand on Sophie’s back and gave her daughter a little shove, and they were off, trudging 
[LINE_0102] through the tall grass of the orchard and out onto the dusty road. 
[LINE_0103] 
[LINE_0104] “He’s handsome,” Rachel said as they came to the airfield, which was abuzz with activity behind the 
[LINE_0105] 
[LINE_0106] 
[LINE_0107] 
[LINE_0108] 
[LINE_0109] coils of barbed wire. “You didn’t tell me that.” 
[LINE_0110] 
[LINE_0111] 
[LINE_0112] 
[LINE_0113] “Is he?” 
[LINE_0114] 
[LINE_0115] “I’m pretty sure you know he is, so your question is interesting. What’s he like?” 
[LINE_0116] 
[LINE_0117] “German.” 
[LINE_0118] 
[LINE_0119] “The soldiers billeted with Claire Moreau look like sausages with legs. I hear they drink enough 
[LINE_0120] wine to kill a judge and snore like rooting hogs. You’re lucky, I guess.” 
[LINE_0121] 
[LINE_0122] “You’re the lucky one, Rachel. No one has moved into your house.” 
[LINE_0123] 
[LINE_0124] “Poverty has its reward at last.” She linked her arm through Vianne’s. “Don’t look so stricken, 
[LINE_0125] Vianne. I hear they have orders to be ‘correct.’” 
[LINE_0126] 
[LINE_0127] Vianne looked at her best friend. “Last week, Isabelle chopped off her hair in front of the captain 
[LINE_0128] and said beauty must be verboten.” 
[LINE_0129] 
[LINE_0130] Rachel couldn’t stifle her smile completely. “Oh.” 
[LINE_0131] 
[LINE_0132] “It’s hardly funny. She could get us killed with her temper.” 
[LINE_0133] 
[LINE_0134] Rachel’s smile faded. “Can you talk to her?” 
[LINE_0135] 
[LINE_0136] “Oh, I can talk. When has she ever listened to anyone?” 
[LINE_0137] 
[LINE_0138] * * * 
[LINE_0139] 
[LINE_0140] 
[LINE_0141] 
[LINE_0142] “You are hurting me,” Isabelle said. 
[LINE_0143] 
[LINE_0144] The man yanked her away from the wall and dragged her down the street, moving so fast she had to 
[LINE_0145] run along beside him; she bumped into the stone alley wall with every step. When she tripped on a 
[LINE_0146] cobblestone and almost fell, he tightened his hold and held her upright. 
[LINE_0147] 
[LINE_0148] Think, Isabelle. He wasn’t in uniform, so he must be Gestapo. That was bad. And he’d seen her 
[LINE_0149] defacing the poster. Did it count as an act of sabotage or espionage or resistance to the German 
[LINE_0150] occupation? 
[LINE_0151] 
[LINE_0152] It wasn’t like blowing up a bridge or selling secrets to Britain. 
[LINE_0153] 
[LINE_0154] I was making art ... it was going to be a vase full of flowers ... Not a V for victory, a vase. No 
[LINE_0155] resistance, just a silly girl drawing on the only paper she could find. I have never even heard of General 
[LINE_0156] de Gaulle. 
[LINE_0157] 
[LINE_0158] And what if they didn’t believe her? 
[LINE_0159] 
[LINE_0160] The man stopped in front of an oak door with a black lion’s head knocker at its center. 
[LINE_0161] 
[LINE_0162] He rapped four times on the door. 
[LINE_0163] 
[LINE_0164] “W-where are you taking me?” Was this a back door to the Gestapo headquarters? There were 
[LINE_0165] rumors about these Gestapo interrogators. Supposedly they were ruthless and sadistic, but no one knew 
[LINE_0166] for sure. 
[LINE_0167] 
[LINE_0168] The door opened slowly, revealing an old man in a beret. A hand-rolled cigarette hung from his 
[LINE_0169] fleshy, liver-spotted lips. He saw Isabelle and frowned. 
[LINE_0170] 
[LINE_0171] “Open up,” the man beside Isabelle growled and the old man stepped aside. 
[LINE_0172] 
[LINE_0173] Isabelle was pulled into a room full of smoke. Her eyes stung as she looked around. It was an 
[LINE_0174] 
[LINE_0175] 
[LINE_0176] 
[LINE_0177] 
[LINE_0178] abandoned novelty store that had once sold bonnets and notions and sewing supplies. In the smoky 
[LINE_0179] light, she saw empty display cases that had been shoved up against the walls, empty metal hat racks 
[LINE_0180] were piled in the corner. The window out front had been bricked up and the back door that faced rue La 
[LINE_0181] Grande was padlocked from the inside. 
[LINE_0182] 
[LINE_0183] There were four men in the room: a tall, graying man, dressed in rags, standing in the corner; a boy 
[LINE_0184] seated beside the old man who had opened the door, and a handsome young man in a tattered sweater 
[LINE_0185] and worn pants with scuffed boots who sat at a cafe table. 
[LINE_0186] 
[LINE_0187] “Who is this, Didier?” asked the old man who had opened the door. 
[LINE_0188] 
[LINE_0189] Isabelle got the first good look at her captor — he was big and brawny, with the puffed-up look of a 
[LINE_0190] circus strong man and a heavily jowled, oversized face. 
[LINE_0191] 
[LINE_0192] She stood as tall as possible, with her shoulders pressed back and her chin lifted. She knew she 
[LINE_0193] looked ridiculously young in her plaid skirt and fitted blouse, but she refused to give them the 
[LINE_0194] satisfaction of knowing she was afraid. 
[LINE_0195] 
[LINE_0196] “I found her chalking V’s on the German posters,” said the swarthy man who’d caught her. Didier. 
[LINE_0197] 
[LINE_0198] Isabelle fisted her right hand, trying to mb the orange chalk away without them noticing. 
[LINE_0199] 
[LINE_0200] “Have you nothing to say?” said the old man standing in the corner. He was the boss, obviously. 
[LINE_0201] 
[LINE_0202] “I have no chalk.” 
[LINE_0203] 
[LINE_0204] “I saw her doing it.” 
[LINE_0205] 
[LINE_0206] Isabelle took a chance. “You’re not German,” she said to the strong man. “You’re French. I’d bet 
[LINE_0207] money on it. And you,” she said to the old man who was seated by the boy, “you’re the pork butcher.” 
[LINE_0208] The boy she dismissed altogether, but to the handsome young man in the tattered clothes, she said, “You 
[LINE_0209] look hungry, and I think you’re wearing your brother’s clothes, or something you found hanging on a 
[LINE_0210] line somewhere. Communist.” 
[LINE_0211] 
[LINE_0212] He grinned at her, and it changed his whole demeanor. 
[LINE_0213] 
[LINE_0214] But it was the man standing in the corner she cared about. The one in charge. She took a step toward 
[LINE_0215] him. “You could be Aryan. Maybe you’re forcing the others to be here.” 
[LINE_0216] 
[LINE_0217] “I’ve known him all my life, M’mselle,” the pork butcher said. “I fought beside his father — and 
[LINE_0218] yours — at Somme. You’re Isabelle Rossignol, ouz?” 
[LINE_0219] 
[LINE_0220] She didn’t answer. Was it a trap? 
[LINE_0221] 
[LINE_0222] “No answer,” said the Bolshevik. He rose from his seat, came toward her. “Good for you. Why were 
[LINE_0223] you chalking a V on the poster?” 
[LINE_0224] 
[LINE_0225] Again, Isabelle remained silent. 
[LINE_0226] 
[LINE_0227] “I am Henri Navarre,” he said, close enough now to touch her. “We are not Germans, nor do we 
[LINE_0228] work with them, M’mselle.” He gave her a meaningful look. “Not all of us are passive. Now why were 
[LINE_0229] you marking up their posters?” 
[LINE_0230] 
[LINE_0231] “It was all I could think of,” she said. 
[LINE_0232] 
[LINE_0233] “Meaning?” 
[LINE_0234] 
[LINE_0235] She exhaled evenly. “I heard de Gaulle’s speech on the radio.” 
[LINE_0236] 
[LINE_0237] 
[LINE_0238] 
[LINE_0239] 
[LINE_0240] JdjA m turned to the back of the room, sent a glance to the old man. She watched the two men have 
[LINE_0241] an entire conversation without speaking a word. At the end of it, she knew who the boss was: the 
[LINE_0242] handsome communist. Henri. 
[LINE_0243] 
[LINE_0244] At last, Henri said, turning to her again, “If you could do something more, would you?” 
[LINE_0245] 
[LINE_0246] “What do you mean?” she asked. 
[LINE_0247] 
[LINE_0248] “There is a man in Paris — ” 
[LINE_0249] 
[LINE_0250] “A group, actually, from the Musee de T Homme — ” the burly man corrected him. 
[LINE_0251] 
[LINE_0252] Henri held up a hand. “We don’t say more than we must, Didier. Anyway, there is a man, a printer, 
[LINE_0253] risking his life to make tracts that we can distribute. Maybe if we can get the French to wake up to what 
[LINE_0254] is happening, we have a chance.” Henri reached into a leather bag that hung on his chair and pulled out 
[LINE_0255] a sheaf of papers. A headline jumped out at her: “Vive le General de Gaulle.” 
[LINE_0256] 
[LINE_0257] The text was an open letter to Marechal Petain that expressed criticism of the surrender. At the end it 
[LINE_0258] read, “Nous sommes pour le general de Gaulle. ” We support General de Gaulle. 
[LINE_0259] 
[LINE_0260] “Well?” Henri said quietly, and in that single word, Isabelle heard the call to arms she’d been 
[LINE_0261] waiting for. “Will you distribute them?” 
[LINE_0262] 
[LINE_0263] “Me?” 
[LINE_0264] 
[LINE_0265] “We are communists and radicals,” Henri said. “They are already watching us. You are a girl. And a 
[LINE_0266] pretty one at that. No one would suspect you.” 
[LINE_0267] 
[LINE_0268] Isabelle didn’t hesitate. “I’ll do it.” 
[LINE_0269] 
[LINE_0270] The men started to thank her; Henri silenced them. “The printer is risking his life by writing these 
[LINE_0271] tracts, and someone is risking his or her life by typing them. We are risking our lives by bringing them 
[LINE_0272] here. But you, Isabelle, you are the one who will be caught distributing them — if you are caught. Make 
[LINE_0273] no mistake. This is not chalking a V on a poster. This is punishable by death.” 
[LINE_0274] 
[LINE_0275] “I won’t get caught,” she said. 
[LINE_0276] 
[LINE_0277] Henri smiled at that. “How old are you?” 
[LINE_0278] 
[LINE_0279] “Almost nineteen.” 
[LINE_0280] 
[LINE_0281] “Ah,” he said. “And how can one so young hide this from her family?” 
[LINE_0282] 
[LINE_0283] “My family’s not the problem,” Isabelle said. “They pay no attention to me. But ... there’s a German 
[LINE_0284] soldier billeted at my house. And I would have to break curfew.” 
[LINE_0285] 
[LINE_0286] “It will not be easy. I understand if you are afraid.” Henri began to turn away. 
[LINE_0287] 
[LINE_0288] Isabelle snatched the papers back from him. “I said I’d do it.” 
[LINE_0289] 
[LINE_0290] * * * 
[LINE_0291] 
[LINE_0292] Isabelle was elated. For the first time since the armistice, she wasn’t completely alone in her need to do 
[LINE_0293] something for France. The men told her about dozens of groups like theirs throughout the country, 
[LINE_0294] mounting a resistance to follow de Gaulle. The more they talked, the more excited she became at the 
[LINE_0295] prospect of joining them. Oh, she knew she should be afraid. (They told her often enough.) 
[LINE_0296] 
[LINE_0297] But it was ridiculous — the Germans threatening death for handing out a few pieces of paper. She 
[LINE_0298] 
[LINE_0299] 
[LINE_0300] 
[LINE_0301] could talk her way out of it if she were caught; she was sure of it. Not that she would get caught. How 
[LINE_0302] many times had she sneaked out of a locked school or boarded a train without a ticket or talked her way 
[LINE_0303] out of trouble? Her beauty had always made it easy for her to break rules without reprisal. 
[LINE_0304] 
[LINE_0305] “When we have more, how will we contact you?” Henri asked as he opened the door to let her leave. 
[LINE_0306] 
[LINE_0307] She glanced down the street. “The apartment above Madame La Foy’s hat shop. Is it still vacant?” 
[LINE_0308] 
[LINE_0309] Henri nodded. 
[LINE_0310] 
[LINE_0311] “Open the curtains when you have papers. I’ll come by as soon as I can.” 
[LINE_0312] 
[LINE_0313] “Knock four times. If we don’t answer, walk away,” he said. After a pause, he added, “Be careful, 
[LINE_0314] Isabelle.” 
[LINE_0315] 
[LINE_0316] He shut the door between them. 
[LINE_0317] 
[LINE_0318] Alone again, she looked down at her basket. Settled under a red-and-white-checked linen cloth were 
[LINE_0319] the tracts. On top lay the butcher-paper-wrapped ham hocks. It wasn’t much of a camouflage. She 
[LINE_0320] would need to figure out something better. 
[LINE_0321] 
[LINE_0322] She walked down the alley and turned onto a busy street. The sky was darkening. She’d been with 
[LINE_0323] the men all day. The shops were closing up; the only people milling about were German soldiers and the 
[LINE_0324] few women who’d chosen to keep them company. The cafe tables out on the street were full of 
[LINE_0325] uniformed men eating the best food, drinking the best wines. 
[LINE_0326] 
[LINE_0327] It took every ounce of nerve she had to walk slowly. The minute she was out of town, she started to 
[LINE_0328] run. As she neared the airfield, she was sweating and out of breath, but she didn’t slow. She ran all the 
[LINE_0329] way into her yard. With the gate clattering shut behind her, she bent forward, gasping hard, holding the 
[LINE_0330] stitch in her side, trying to catch her breath. 
[LINE_0331] 
[LINE_0332] “M’mselle Rossignol, are you unwell?” 
[LINE_0333] 
[LINE_0334] Isabelle snapped upright. 
[LINE_0335] 
[LINE_0336] Captain Beck appeared beside her. Had he been there before her? 
[LINE_0337] 
[LINE_0338] “Captain,” she said, working hard to still the racing of her heart. “A convoy went past ... I ... uh, 
[LINE_0339] rushed to get out of their way.” 
[LINE_0340] 
[LINE_0341] “A convoy? I didn’t see that.” 
[LINE_0342] 
[LINE_0343] “It was a while back. And I am ... silly sometimes. I lost track of time, talking to a friend, and, 
[LINE_0344] well...” She gave him her prettiest smile and patted her butchered hair as if it mattered to her that she 
[LINE_0345] looked nice for him. 
[LINE_0346] 
[LINE_0347] “How were the queues today?” 
[LINE_0348] 
[LINE_0349] “Interminable.” 
[LINE_0350] 
[LINE_0351] “Please, allow me to carry your basket inside.” 
[LINE_0352] 
[LINE_0353] She looked down at her basket, saw the tiniest white paper corner visible under the linen cloth. “No, 
[LINE_0354] 
[LINE_0355] I—” 
[LINE_0356] 
[LINE_0357] “Ah, I insist. We are gentlemen, you know.” 
[LINE_0358] 
[LINE_0359] His long, well-manicured fingers closed around the willow handle. As he turned toward the house, 
[LINE_0360] she remained at his side. “I saw a large group gathering at the town hall this afternoon. What are the 
[LINE_0361] 
[LINE_0362] 
[LINE_0363] 
[LINE_0364] 
[LINE_0365] Vichy police doing here?” 
[LINE_0366] 
[LINE_0367] “Ah. Nothing to concern you.” He waited at the front door for her to open it. She fumbled nervously 
[LINE_0368] with the center-mounted knob, turned it, and opened the door. Although he had every right to go in at 
[LINE_0369] will, he waited to be invited in, as if he were a guest. 
[LINE_0370] 
[LINE_0371] “Isabelle, is that you? Where have you been?” Vianne rose from the divan. 
[LINE_0372] 
[LINE_0373] “The queues were awful today.” 
[LINE_0374] 
[LINE_0375] Sophie popped up from the floor by the fireplace, where she’d been playing with Bebe. “What did
