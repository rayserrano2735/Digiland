[LINE_0376] lives of hundreds of Allied airmen in the Great War. She is famous for saying that ‘patriotism is not 
[LINE_0377] enough.’ And this is your hero, a woman executed by the enemy.” 
[LINE_0378] 
[LINE_0379] “A woman who made a difference,” Isabelle said, studying him. “I am relying on you — a criminal 
[LINE_0380] and a communist — to help me make a difference. Perhaps I am as mad and impetuous as they say.” 
[LINE_0381] 
[LINE_0382] “Who are ‘they’?” 
[LINE_0383] 
[LINE_0384] “Everyone.” She paused, felt her expectation gather close. She had made a point of never trusting 
[LINE_0385] anyone, and yet she believed Gaetan. He looked at her as if she mattered. “You will take me. As you 
[LINE_0386] promised.” 
[LINE_0387] 
[LINE_0388] “You know how such bargains are sealed?” 
[LINE_0389] 
[LINE_0390] “How?” 
[LINE_0391] 
[LINE_0392] “With a kiss.” 
[LINE_0393] 
[LINE_0394] “Quit teasing. This is serious.” 
[LINE_0395] 
[LINE_0396] “What’s more serious than a kiss on the brink of war?” He was smiling, but not quite. That banked 
[LINE_0397] anger was in his eyes again, and it frightened her, reminded her that she really didn’t know him at all. 
[LINE_0398] 
[LINE_0399] “I would kiss a man who was brave enough to take me into battle with him.” 
[LINE_0400] 
[LINE_0401] “I think you know nothing of kissing,” he said with a sigh. 
[LINE_0402] 
[LINE_0403] 
[LINE_0404] 
[LINE_0405] 
[LINE_0406] “Shows what you know.” She rolled away from him and immediately missed his touch. Trying to be 
[LINE_0407] nonchalant, she rolled back to face him and felt his breath on her eyelashes. “You may kiss me then. To 
[LINE_0408] seal our deal.” 
[LINE_0409] 
[LINE_0410] He reached out slowly, put a hand around the back of her neck, and pulled her toward him. 
[LINE_0411] 
[LINE_0412] “Are you sure?” he asked, his lips almost touching hers. She didn’t know if he was asking about 
[LINE_0413] going off to war or granting permission for a kiss, but right now, in this moment, it didn’t matter. 
[LINE_0414] Isabelle had traded kisses with boys as if they were pennies to be left on park benches and lost in chair 
[LINE_0415] cushions — meaningless. Never before, not once, had she really yearned for a kiss. 
[LINE_0416] 
[LINE_0417] “Ouz,” she whispered, leaning toward him. 
[LINE_0418] 
[LINE_0419] At his kiss, something opened up inside the scraped, empty interior of her heart, unfurled. For the 
[LINE_0420] first time, her romantic novels made sense; she realized that the landscape of a woman’s soul could 
[LINE_0421] change as quickly as a world at war. 
[LINE_0422] 
[LINE_0423] “I love you,” she whispered. She hadn’t said these words since she was four years old; then, it had 
[LINE_0424] been to her mother. At her declaration, Gaetan’s expression changed, hardened. The smile he gave her 
[LINE_0425] was so tight and false she couldn’t make sense of it. “What? Did I do something wrong?” 
[LINE_0426] 
[LINE_0427] “No. Of course not,” he said. 
[LINE_0428] 
[LINE_0429] “We are lucky to have found each other,” she said. 
[LINE_0430] 
[LINE_0431] “We are not lucky, Isabelle. Trust me on this.” As he said it, he drew her in for another kiss. 
[LINE_0432] 
[LINE_0433] She gave herself over to the sensations of the kiss, let it become the whole of her universe, and knew 
[LINE_0434] finally how it felt to be enough for someone. 
[LINE_0435] 
[LINE_0436] 
[LINE_0437] 
[LINE_0438] * * * 
[LINE_0439] 
[LINE_0440] When Vianne awoke, she noticed the quiet first. Somewhere a bird sang. She lay perfectly still in bed, 
[LINE_0441] listening. Beside her Sophie snored and grumbled in her sleep. 
[LINE_0442] 
[LINE_0443] Vianne went to the window, lifting the blackout shade. 
[LINE_0444] 
[LINE_0445] In her yard, apple branches hung like broken arms from the trees; the gate hung sideways, two of its 
[LINE_0446] three hinges ripped out. Across the road, the hayfield was flattened, the flowers crushed. The refugees 
[LINE_0447] who’d come through had left belongings and refuse in their wake — suitcases, buggies, coats too heavy 
[LINE_0448] to carry and too hot to wear, pillowcases, and wagons. 
[LINE_0449] 
[LINE_0450] Vianne went downstairs and cautiously opened the front door. Listening for noise — hearing none — 
[LINE_0451] she unlatched the lock and turned the knob. 
[LINE_0452] 
[LINE_0453] They had destroyed her garden, ripping up anything that looked edible, leaving broken stalks and 
[LINE_0454] mounds of dirt. 
[LINE_0455] 
[LINE_0456] Everything was ruined, gone. Feeling defeated, she walked around the house to the backyard, which 
[LINE_0457] had also been ravaged. 
[LINE_0458] 
[LINE_0459] She was about to go back inside when she heard a sound. A mewling. Maybe a baby crying. 
[LINE_0460] 
[LINE_0461] There it was again. Had someone left an infant behind? 
[LINE_0462] 
[LINE_0463] She moved cautiously across the yard to the wooden pergola draped in roses and jasmine. 
[LINE_0464] 
[LINE_0465] 
[LINE_0466] 
[LINE_0467] 
[LINE_0468] Isabelle lay curled up on the ground, her dress ripped to shreds, her face cut up and bruised, her left 
[LINE_0469] eye swollen nearly shut, a piece of paper pinned to her bodice. 
[LINE_0470] 
[LINE_0471] “Isabelle!” 
[LINE_0472] 
[LINE_0473] Her sister’s chin tilted upward slightly; she opened one bloodshot eye. “V,” she said in a cracked, 
[LINE_0474] hoarse voice. “Thanks for locking me out.” 
[LINE_0475] 
[LINE_0476] Vianne went to her sister and knelt beside her. “Isabelle, you are covered in blood and bruised. Were 
[LINE_0477] you...” 
[LINE_0478] 
[LINE_0479] Isabelle seemed not to understand for a moment. “Oh. It is not my blood. Most of it isn’t, anyway.” 
[LINE_0480] She looked around. “Where’s Gaet?” 
[LINE_0481] 
[LINE_0482] “What?” 
[LINE_0483] 
[LINE_0484] Isabelle staggered to her feet, almost toppling over. “Did he leave me? He did.” She started to cry. 
[LINE_0485] “He left me.” 
[LINE_0486] 
[LINE_0487] “Come on,” Vianne said gently. She guided her sister into the cool interior of the house, where 
[LINE_0488] Isabelle kicked off her blood-splattered shoes, let them crack into the wall and clatter to the floor. 
[LINE_0489] Bloody footprints followed them to the bathroom tucked beneath the stairs. 
[LINE_0490] 
[LINE_0491] While Vianne heated water and filled the bath, Isabelle sat on the floor, her legs splayed out, her feet 
[LINE_0492] discolored by blood, muttering to herself and wiping tears from her eyes, which turned to mud on her 
[LINE_0493] cheeks. 
[LINE_0494] 
[LINE_0495] When the bath was ready, Vianne returned to Isabelle, gently undressing her. Isabelle was like a 
[LINE_0496] child, pliable, whimpering in pain. 
[LINE_0497] 
[LINE_0498] Vianne _nbuttoned the back of Isabelle’s once-red dress and peeled it away, afraid that the slightest 
[LINE_0499] breath might topple her sister over. Isabelle’s lacy undergarments were stained in places with blood. 
[LINE_0500] Vianne unlaced the corseted midsection of the foundation and eased it off. 
[LINE_0501] 
[LINE_0502] Isabelle gritted her teeth and stepped into the tub. 
[LINE_0503] 
[LINE_0504] “Lean back.” 
[LINE_0505] 
[LINE_0506] Isabelle did as she was told, and Vianne poured hot water over her sister’s head, keeping the water 
[LINE_0507] from her sister’s eyes. A11 the while, as she washed Isabelle’s dirty hair and bruised body, she kept up a 
[LINE_0508] steady, soothing croon of meaningless words, meant to comfort. 
[LINE_0509] 
[LINE_0510] She helped Isabelle out of the tub and dried her body with a soft, white towel. Isabelle stared at her, 
[LINE_0511] slack-jawed, blank-eyed. 
[LINE_0512] 
[LINE_0513] “How about some sleep?” Vianne said. 
[LINE_0514] 
[LINE_0515] “Sleep,” Isabelle mumbled, her head lolling to one side. 
[LINE_0516] 
[LINE_0517] Vianne brought Isabelle a nightdress that smelled of lavender and rose water and helped her into it. 
[LINE_0518] Isabelle could hardly keep her eyes open as Vianne guided her to the upstairs bedroom and settled her 
[LINE_0519] beneath a light blanket. Isabelle was asleep before her head hit the pillow. 
[LINE_0520] 
[LINE_0521] * * * 
[LINE_0522] 
[LINE_0523] Isabelle woke to darkness. She remembered daylight. 
[LINE_0524] 
[LINE_0525] 
[LINE_0526] 
[LINE_0527] Where was she? 
[LINE_0528] 
[LINE_0529] She sat up so quickly her head spun. She took a few shallow breaths and then looked around. 
[LINE_0530] 
[LINE_0531] The upstairs bedroom at Le Jardin. Her old room. It did not give her a warm feeling. How often had 
[LINE_0532] Madame Doom locked her in the bedroom “for her own good”? 
[LINE_0533] 
[LINE_0534] “Don’t think about that,” she said aloud. 
[LINE_0535] 
[LINE_0536] An even worse memory followed: Gaetan. He had abandoned her after all; it filled her with the kind 
[LINE_0537] of bone-deep disappointment she knew so well. 
[LINE_0538] 
[LINE_0539] Had she learned nothing in life? People left. She knew that. They especially left her. 
[LINE_0540] 
[LINE_0541] She dressed in the shapeless blue housedress Vianne had left draped across the foot of the bed. Then 
[LINE_0542] she went down the narrow, shallow-stepped stairs, holding on to the iron banister. Every pain-filled step 
[LINE_0543] felt like a triumph. 
[LINE_0544] 
[LINE_0545] Downstairs, the house was quiet except for the crackling, staticky sound of a radio on at a low 
[LINE_0546] volume. She was pretty sure Maurice Chevalier was singing a love song. Perfect. 
[LINE_0547] 
[LINE_0548] Vianne was in the kitchen, wearing a gingham apron over a pale yellow housedress. A floral scarf 
[LINE_0549] covered her hair. She was peeling potatoes with a paring knife. Behind her, a cast-iron pot made a 
[LINE_0550] cheery little bubbling sound. 
[LINE_0551] 
[LINE_0552] The aromas made Isabelle’s mouth water. 
[LINE_0553] 
[LINE_0554] Vianne rushed forward to pull out a chair at the small table in the kitchen’s corner. “Here, sit.” 
[LINE_0555] 
[LINE_0556] Isabelle fell onto the seat. Vianne brought her a plate that was already prepared. A hunk of still- 
[LINE_0557] warm bread, a triangle of cheese, a smear of quince paste, and a few slices of ham. 
[LINE_0558] 
[LINE_0559] Isabelle took the bread in her red, scraped-up hands, lifting it to her face, breathing in the yeasty 
[LINE_0560] smell. Her hands were shaking as she picked up a knife and slathered the bread with fruit and cheese. 
[LINE_0561] When she set down the knife it clattered. She picked up the bread and bit into it; the single best bite of 
[LINE_0562] food of her life. The hard crust of the bread, its pillow-soft interior, the buttery cheese, and the fruit all 
[LINE_0563] combined to make her practically swoon. She ate the rest of it like a madwoman, barely noticing the cup 
[LINE_0564] of cafe noir her sister had set down beside her. 
[LINE_0565] 
[LINE_0566] “Where’s Sophie?” Isabelle asked, her cheeks bulging with food. It was difficult to stop eating, even 
[LINE_0567] to be polite. She reached for a peach, felt its fuzzy ripeness in her hand, and bit into it. Juice dribbled 
[LINE_0568] down her chin. 
[LINE_0569] 
[LINE_0570] “She’s next door, playing with Sarah. You remember my friend, Rachel?” 
[LINE_0571] 
[LINE_0572] “I remember her,” Isabelle said. 
[LINE_0573] 
[LINE_0574] Vianne poured herself a tiny cup of espresso and brought it to the table, where she sat down. 
[LINE_0575] 
[LINE_0576] Isabelle burped and covered her mouth. “Pardon.” 
[LINE_0577] 
[LINE_0578] “I think a lapse in manners can be overlooked,” Vianne said with a smile. 
[LINE_0579] 
[LINE_0580] “You haven’t met Madame Dufour. No doubt she would hit me with a brick for that transgression.” 
[LINE_0581] Isabelle sighed. Her stomach hurt now; she felt like she might vomit. She wiped her moist chin with her 
[LINE_0582] sleeve. “What is the news from Paris?” 
[LINE_0583] 
[LINE_0584] “The swastika flag flies from the Eiffel Tower.” 
[LINE_0585] 
[LINE_0586] 
[LINE_0587] 
[LINE_0588] 
[LINE_0589] “And Papa?” 
[LINE_0590] 
[LINE_0591] “Fine, he says.” 
[LINE_0592] 
[LINE_0593] “Worried about me, I’ll bet,” Isabelle said bitterly. “He shouldn’t have sent me away. But when has 
[LINE_0594] he ever done anything else?” 
[LINE_0595] 
[LINE_0596] A look passed between them. It was one of the few memories they shared, that abandonment, but 
[LINE_0597] clearly Vianne didn’t want to remember it. “We hear there were more than ten million of you on the 
[LINE_0598] roads.” 
[LINE_0599] 
[LINE_0600] “The crowds weren’t the worst of it,” Isabelle said. “We were mostly women and children, V, and 
[LINE_0601] old men and boys. And they just . . . obliterated us.” 
[LINE_0602] 
[LINE_0603] “It’s over now, thank God,” Vianne said. “It’s best to focus on the good. Who is Gaetan? You spoke 
[LINE_0604] of him in your delirium.” 
[LINE_0605] 
[LINE_0606] Isabelle pickeo aL one of the scrapes on the back of her hand, realizing an instant too late that she 
[LINE_0607] should have let it alone. The scab ripped away and blood bubbled up. 
[LINE_0608] 
[LINE_0609] “Maybe he has to do with this,” Vianne said when the silence elongated. She pulled a crumpled 
[LINE_0610] piece of paper out of her apron pocket. It was the note that had been pinned to Isabelle’s bodice. Dirty, 
[LINE_0611] bloody fingerprints ran across the paper. On it was written: You are not ready. 
[LINE_0612] 
[LINE_0613] Isabelle felt the world drop out from under her. It was a ridiculous, girlish reaction, overblown, and 
[LINE_0614] she knew it, but still it hit her hard, wounded deep. He had wanted to take her with him until the kiss. 
[LINE_0615] Somehow he’d tasted the lack in her. “He’s no one,” she said grimly, taking the note, crumpling it. “Just 
[LINE_0616] a boy with black hair and a sharp face who tells lies. He’s nothing.” Then she looked at Vianne. “I’m 
[LINE_0617] going off to the war. I don’t care what anyone thinks. I’ll drive an ambulance or roll bandages. 
[LINE_0618] Anything.” 
[LINE_0619] 
[LINE_0620] “Oh, for heaven’s sake, Isabelle. Paris is overrun. The Nazis control the city. What is an eighteen- 
[LINE_0621] year-old girl to do about all of that?” 
[LINE_0622] 
[LINE_0623] “I am not hiding out in the country while the Nazis destroy France. And let’s face it, you have never 
[LINE_0624] exactly felt sisterly toward me.” Her aching face tightened. “I’ll be leaving as soon as I can walk.” 
[LINE_0625] 
[LINE_0626] “You will be safe here, Isabelle. That’s what matters. You must stay.” 
[LINE_0627] 
[LINE_0628] “Safe?” Isabelle spat. “You think that is what matters now, Vianne? Let me tell you what I saw out 
[LINE_0629] there. French troops mnning from the enemy. Nazis murdering innocents. Maybe you can ignore that, 
[LINE_0630] but I won’t.” 
[LINE_0631] 
[LINE_0632] “You will stay here and be safe. We will speak of it no more.” 
[LINE_0633] 
[LINE_0634] “When have I ever been safe with you, Vianne?” Isabelle said, seeing hurt blossom in her sister’s 
[LINE_0635] eyes. 
[LINE_0636] 
[LINE_0637] “I was young, Isabelle. I tried to be a mother to you.” 
[LINE_0638] 
[LINE_0639] “Oh, please. Let’s not start with a lie.” 
[LINE_0640] 
[LINE_0641] “After I lost the baby — ” 
[LINE_0642] 
[LINE_0643] Isabelle turned her back on her sister and limped away before she said something unforgiveable. She 
[LINE_0644] clasped her hands to still their trembling. This was why she hadn’t wanted to return to this house and see 
[LINE_0645] 
[LINE_0646] 
[LINE_0647] 
[LINE_0648] her sister, why she’d stayed away for years. There was too much pain between them. She turned up the 
[LINE_0649] radio to drown out her thoughts. 
[LINE_0650] 
[LINE_0651] A voice crackled over the airwaves. “... Marechal Petain speaking to you...” 
[LINE_0652] 
[LINE_0653] Isabelle frowned. Petain was a hero of the Great War, a beloved leader of France. She turned up the 
[LINE_0654] volume further. 
[LINE_0655] 
[LINE_0656] Vianne appeared beside her. 
[LINE_0657] 
[LINE_0658] “... I assumed the direction of the government of France...” 
[LINE_0659] 
[LINE_0660] Static overtook his deep voice, crackled through it. 
[LINE_0661] 
[LINE_0662] Isabelle thumped the radio impatiently. 
[LINE_0663] 
[LINE_0664] “... our admirable army, which is fighting with a heroism worthy of its long military traditions 
[LINE_0665] against an enemy superior in numbers and arms...” 
[LINE_0666] 
[LINE_0667] Static. Isabelle hit the radio again, whispering, “Zut.” 
[LINE_0668] 
[LINE_0669] "... in these painful hours I think of the unhappy refugees who, in extreme misery, clog our roads. I 
[LINE_0670] express to them my compassion and my solicitude. It is with a broken heart that I tell you today it is 
[LINE_0671] necessary to stop fighting.” 
[LINE_0672] 
[LINE_0673] “We’ve won?” Vianne said. 
[LINE_0674] 
[LINE_0675] “Shhh,” Isabelle said sharply. 
[LINE_0676] 
[LINE_0677] “... addressed myself last night to the adversary to ask him if he is ready to speak with me, as 
[LINE_0678] soldier to soldier, after the actual fighting is over, and with honor, the means of putting an end to 
[LINE_0679] hostilities.” 
[LINE_0680] 
[LINE_0681] The old man’s words droned on, saying things like “trying days” and “control their anguish” and, 
[LINE_0682] worst of all, “destiny of the fatherland.” Then he said the word Isabelle never thought she’d hear in 
[LINE_0683] France. 
[LINE_0684] 
[LINE_0685] Surrender. 
[LINE_0686] 
[LINE_0687] Isabelle hobbled out of the room on her bloody feet and went into the backyard, needing air 
[LINE_0688] suddenly, unable to draw a decent breath. 
[LINE_0689] 
[LINE_0690] Surrender. France. To Hitler. 
[LINE_0691] 
[LINE_0692] “It must be for the best,” her sister said calmly. 
[LINE_0693] 
[LINE_0694] When had Vianne come out here? 
[LINE_0695] 
[LINE_0696] “You’ve heard about Marechal Petain. He is a hero unparalleled. If he says we must quit fighting, 
[LINE_0697] we must. I’m sure he’ll reason with Hitler.” Vianne reached out. 
[LINE_0698] 
[LINE_0699] Isabelle yanked away. The thought of Vianne’s comforting touch made her feel sick. She limped 
[LINE_0700] around to face her sister. “You don’t reason with men like Hitler.” 
[LINE_0701] 
[LINE_0702] “So you know more than our heroes now?” 
[LINE_0703] 
[LINE_0704] “I know we shouldn’t give up.” 
[LINE_0705] 
[LINE_0706] Vianne made a tsking sound, a little scuff of disappointment. “If Marechal Petain thinks surrender is 
[LINE_0707] best for France, it is. Period. At least the war will be over and our men will come home.” 
[LINE_0708] 
[LINE_0709] “You are a fool.” 
[LINE_0710] 
[LINE_0711] 
[LINE_0712] 
[LINE_0713] 
[LINE_0714] Vianne said, “Fine,” and went back into the house. 
[LINE_0715] 
[LINE_0716] Isabelle tented a hand over her eyes and stared up into the bright and cloudless sky. How long would 
[LINE_0717] it be before all this blue was filled with German aeroplanes? 
[LINE_0718] 
[LINE_0719] She didn’t know how long she stood there, imagining the worst — remembering how the Nazis had 
[LINE_0720] opened fire on innocent women and children in Tours, obliterating them, turning the grass red with their 
[LINE_0721] blood. 
[LINE_0722] 
[LINE_0723] “Tante Isabelle?” 
[LINE_0724] 
[LINE_0725] Isabelle heard the small, tentative voice as if from far away. She turned slowly. 
[LINE_0726] 
[LINE_0727] A beautiful girl stood at Le Jardin’s back door. She had skin like her mother’s, as pale as fine 
[LINE_0728] porcelain, and expressive eyes that appeared coal black from this distance, as dark as her father’s. She 
[LINE_0729] could have stepped from the pages of a fairy tale — Snow White or Sleeping Beauty. 
[LINE_0730] 
[LINE_0731] “You can’t be Sophie,” Isabelle said. “The last time I saw you ... you were sucking your thumb.” 
[LINE_0732] 
[LINE_0733] “I still do sometimes,” Sophie said with a conspiratorial smile. “You won’t tell?” 
[LINE_0734] 
[LINE_0735] “Me? I am the best of secret keepers.” Isabelle moved toward her, thinking, my niece. Family. “Shall 
[LINE_0736] I tell you a secret about me, just so that we are fair?” 
[LINE_0737] 
[LINE_0738] Sophie nodded earnestly, her eyes widening. 
[LINE_0739] 
[LINE_0740] “I can make myself invisible.” 
[LINE_0741] 
[LINE_0742] “No, you can’t.” 
[LINE_0743] 
[LINE_0744] Isabelle saw Vianne appear at the back door. “Ask your maman. I have sneaked onto trains and 
[LINE_0745] climbed out of windows and run away from convent dungeons. All of this because I can disappear.” 
[LINE_0746] 
[LINE_0747] “Isabelle,” Vianne said sternly. 
[LINE_0748] 
[LINE_0749] Sophie stared up at Isabelle, enraptured. “Really?” 
[LINE_0750]
