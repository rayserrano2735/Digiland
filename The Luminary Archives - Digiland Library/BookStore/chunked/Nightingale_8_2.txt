[LINE_0376] When the hall was full, the soldiers closed the oak doors, which creaked in protest. The officer at the 
[LINE_0377] front of the hall faced them, shot his right arm out, and said, “Heil Hitler. ” 
[LINE_0378] 
[LINE_0379] The crowd murmured softly among themselves. What should they do? “Heil Hitler a few said 
[LINE_0380] grudgingly. The room began to smell of sweat and leather polish and cigarette smoke. 
[LINE_0381] 
[LINE_0382] “I am Sturmbannfiihrer Weldt of the Geheime Staatspolizei. The Gestapo,” the man in the black 
[LINE_0383] uniform said in heavily accented French. “I am here to carry out the terms of the armistice on behalf of 
[LINE_0384] the fatherland and the Fiihrer. It will be of little hardship on those of you who obey the rules.” He 
[LINE_0385] cleared his throat. 
[LINE_0386] 
[LINE_0387] “The rules: All radios are to be turned in to us at the town hall, immediately, as are all guns, 
[LINE_0388] explosives, and ammunition. All operational vehicles will be impounded. All windows will be equipped 
[LINE_0389] with material for blackout, and you shall use it. A nine p.m. curfew is instantly in effect. No lights shall 
[LINE_0390] be on after dusk. We will control all food, whether grown or imported.” He paused, looked out over the 
[LINE_0391] mass of people standing in front of him. “Not so bad, see? We will live together in harmony, yes? But 
[LINE_0392] 
[LINE_0393] 
[LINE_0394] 
[LINE_0395] 
[LINE_0396] know this. Any act of sabotage or espionage or resistance will be dealt with swiftly and without mercy. 
[LINE_0397] The punishment for such behavior is death by execution.” He pulled a pack of cigarettes from his breast 
[LINE_0398] pocket and extracted a single cigarette. Lighting it, he stared out at the people so intently it seemed he 
[LINE_0399] was memorizing each face. “Also, although many of your ragged, cowardly soldiers are returning, we 
[LINE_0400] must inform you that the men taken prisoner by us shall remain in Germany.” 
[LINE_0401] 
[LINE_0402] Vianne felt confusion ripple through the audience. She looked at Rachel, whose square face was 
[LINE_0403] blotchy in places — a sign of anxiety. “Marc and Antoine will come home,” Rachel said stubbornly. 
[LINE_0404] 
[LINE_0405] The Sturmbannfiihrer went on. “You may leave now, as I am sure we understand each other. I will 
[LINE_0406] have officers here until eight forty-five tonight. They will receive your contraband. Do not be late. 
[LINE_0407] And...” He smiled good-naturedly. “Do not risk your lives to keep a radio. Whatever you keep — or hide 
[LINE_0408] — we will find, and if we find it ... death.” He said it so casually, and wearing such a fine smile, that for 
[LINE_0409] a moment, it didn’t sink in. 
[LINE_0410] 
[LINE_0411] The crowd stood there a moment longer, uncertain whether it was safe to move. No one wanted to 
[LINE_0412] be seen as taking the first step, and then suddenly they were moving, pack-like, toward the open doors 
[LINE_0413] that led them outside. 
[LINE_0414] 
[LINE_0415] “Bastards,” Isabelle said as they moved into an alley. 
[LINE_0416] 
[LINE_0417] “And I was so sure they’d let us keep our guns,” Rachel said, lighting up a cigarette, inhaling deeply 
[LINE_0418] and exhaling in a rush. 
[LINE_0419] 
[LINE_0420] “I’m keeping our gun, I can tell you,” Isabelle said in a loud voice. “And our radio.” 
[LINE_0421] 
[LINE_0422] “Shhh,” Vianne said. 
[LINE_0423] 
[LINE_0424] “General de Gaulle thinks — ” 
[LINE_0425] 
[LINE_0426] “I don’t want to hear that foolishness. We have to keep our heads down until our men come home,” 
[LINE_0427] Vianne said. 
[LINE_0428] 
[LINE_0429] “Mon Dieu, ” Isabelle said sharply. “You think your husband can fix this?” 
[LINE_0430] 
[LINE_0431] “No,” Vianne said. “I believe you will fix it, you and your General de Gaulle, of whom no one has 
[LINE_0432] ever heard. Now, come. While you are hatching a plan to save France, I need to tend to my garden. 
[LINE_0433] Come on, Rachel, let us dullards be away.” 
[LINE_0434] 
[LINE_0435] Vianne held tightly to Sophie’s hand and walked briskly ahead. She did not bother to glance back to 
[LINE_0436] see if Isabelle was following. She knew her sister was back there, hobbling forward on her damaged 
[LINE_0437] feet. Ordinarily Vianne would keep pace with her sister, out of politeness, but just now she was too mad 
[LINE_0438] to care. 
[LINE_0439] 
[LINE_0440] “Your sister may not be so wrong,” Rachel said as they passed the Norman church on the edge of 
[LINE_0441] town. 
[LINE_0442] 
[LINE_0443] “If you take her side in this, I may be forced to hurt you, Rachel.” 
[LINE_0444] 
[LINE_0445] “That being said, your sister may not be entirely wrong.” 
[LINE_0446] 
[LINE_0447] Vianne sighed. “Don’t tell her that. She’s unbearable already.” 
[LINE_0448] 
[LINE_0449] “She will have to learn propriety.” 
[LINE_0450] 
[LINE_0451] “You teach her. She has proven singularly resistant to improving herself or listening to reason. She’s 
[LINE_0452] 
[LINE_0453] 
[LINE_0454] 
[LINE_0455] been to two finishing schools and still can’t hold her tongue or make polite conversation. Two days ago, 
[LINE_0456] instead of going to town for meat, she hid the valuables and created a hiding place for us. Just in case.” 
[LINE_0457] “I should probably hide mine, too. Not that we have much.” 
[LINE_0458] 
[LINE_0459] Vianne pursed her lips. There was no point in talking further about this. Soon, Antoine would be 
[LINE_0460] home and he would help keep Isabelle in line. 
[LINE_0461] 
[LINE_0462] At the gate to Le Jardin, Vianne said good-bye to Rachel and her children, who kept walking. 
[LINE_0463] 
[LINE_0464] “Why do we have to give them our radio, Maman?” Sophie asked. “It belongs to Papa.” 
[LINE_0465] 
[LINE_0466] “We don’t,” Isabelle said, coming up beside them. “We will hide it.” 
[LINE_0467] 
[LINE_0468] “We will not hide it,” Vianne said sharply. “We will do as we are told and keep quiet and soon 
[LINE_0469] Antoine will be home and he will know what to do.” 
[LINE_0470] 
[LINE_0471] “Welcome to the Middle Ages, Sophie,” Isabelle said. 
[LINE_0472] 
[LINE_0473] Vianne yanked her gate open, forgetting a second too late that the refugees had broken it. The poor 
[LINE_0474] thing clattered on its single hinge. It took all of Vianne’s fortitr J ~ to act as if it hadn’t happened. She 
[LINE_0475] marched up to the house, opened the door, and immediately turned on the kitchen light. “Sophie,” she 
[LINE_0476] said, unpinning her hat. “Would you please set the table?” 
[LINE_0477] 
[LINE_0478] Vianne ignored her daughter’s grumbling — it was to be expected. In only a few days, Isabelle had 
[LINE_0479] taught her niece to challenge authority. 
[LINE_0480] 
[LINE_0481] Vianne lit the stove and started cooking. When a creamy potato and lardon soup was simmering, she 
[LINE_0482] began to clean up. Of course Isabelle was nowhere around to help. Sighing, she filled the sink with 
[LINE_0483] water to wash dishes. She was so intent on her task that it took her a moment to notice that someone 
[LINE_0484] was knocking on the front door. Patting her hair, she walked into the living room, where she found 
[LINE_0485] Isabelle rising from the divan, a book in her hands. Reading while Vianne cooked and cleaned. 
[LINE_0486] Naturally. 
[LINE_0487] 
[LINE_0488] “Are you expecting anyone?” Isabelle asked. 
[LINE_0489] 
[LINE_0490] Vianne shook her head. 
[LINE_0491] 
[LINE_0492] “Maybe we shouldn’t answer,” Isabelle said. “Pretend we’re not here.” 
[LINE_0493] 
[LINE_0494] “It’s most likely Rachel.” 
[LINE_0495] 
[LINE_0496] There was another knock at the door. 
[LINE_0497] 
[LINE_0498] Slowly, the doorknob turned, and the door creaked open. 
[LINE_0499] 
[LINE_0500] Yes. Of course it was Rachel. Who else would — 
[LINE_0501] 
[LINE_0502] A German soldier stepped into her home. 
[LINE_0503] 
[LINE_0504] “Oh, my pardons,” the man said in terrible French. He removed his military hat, tucked it in his 
[LINE_0505] armpit, and smiled. He was a good-looking man — tall and broad-shouldered and narrow-hipped, with 
[LINE_0506] pale skin and light gray eyes. Vianne guessed he was roughly her age. His field uniform was precisely 
[LINE_0507] pressed and looked brand new. An iron cross decorated his stand-up collar. Binoculars hung from a 
[LINE_0508] strap around his neck and a chunky leather utility belt cinched his waist. Behind him, through the 
[LINE_0509] branches of the orchard, she saw his motorcycle parked on the side of the road. A sidecar was attached 
[LINE_0510] to it, mounted with machine guns. 
[LINE_0511] 
[LINE_0512] 
[LINE_0513] 
[LINE_0514] “Mademoiselle,” he said to Vianne, giving her a swift nod as he clicked his boots together. 
[LINE_0515] “Madame,” she corrected him, wishing she sounded haughty and in control, but even to her own 
[LINE_0516] ears she sounded scared. “Madame Mauriac.” 
[LINE_0517] 
[LINE_0518] “I am Hauptmann — Captain — Wolfgang Beck.” He handed her a piece of paper. “My French is not 
[LINE_0519] so good. You will excuse my ineptitude, please.” When he smiled, deep dimples formed in his cheeks. 
[LINE_0520] She took the paper and frowned down at it. “I don’t read German.” 
[LINE_0521] 
[LINE_0522] “What do you want?” Isabelle demanded, coming to stand by Vianne. 
[LINE_0523] 
[LINE_0524] “Your home is most beautiful and very close to the airfield. I noticed it upon our arrival. How many 
[LINE_0525] bedrooms have you?” 
[LINE_0526] 
[LINE_0527] “Why?” Isabelle said at the same time Vianne said, “Three.” 
[LINE_0528] 
[LINE_0529] “I will billry here,” the captain said in his bad French. 
[LINE_0530] 
[LINE_0531] “Billet?” Vianne said. “You mean ... to stay?” 
[LINE_0532] 
[LINE_0533] “Old, Madame.” 
[LINE_0534] 
[LINE_0535] “Billet? You? A man? A Nazi? No. No.” Isabelle shook her head. “No.” 
[LINE_0536] 
[LINE_0537] The captain’s smile neither faded nor fell. “You were to town,” he said, looking at Isabelle. “I saw 
[LINE_0538] you when we arrived.” 
[LINE_0539] 
[LINE_0540] “You noticed me?” 
[LINE_0541] 
[LINE_0542] He smiled. “I am sure every red-blooded man in my regiment noticed you.” 
[LINE_0543] 
[LINE_0544] “Funny you would mention blood,” Isabelle said. 
[LINE_0545] 
[LINE_0546] Vianne elbowed her sister. “I am sorry, Captain. My young sister is obstinate on occasion. But I am 
[LINE_0547] married, you see, and my husband is at the front, and there is my sister and my daughter here, so you 
[LINE_0548] must see how inappropriate it would be to have you here.” 
[LINE_0549] 
[LINE_0550] “Ah, so you would rather leave the house to me. How difficult that must be for you.” 
[LINE_0551] 
[LINE_0552] “Leave?” Vianne said. 
[LINE_0553] 
[LINE_0554] “I believe you aren’t understanding the captain,” Isabelle said, not taking her gaze from him. “He’s 
[LINE_0555] moving into your home, taking it over, really, and that piece of paper is a requisition order that makes it 
[LINE_0556] possible. And Petain’s armistice, of course. We can either make room for him or abandon a home that 
[LINE_0557] has been in our family for generations.” 
[LINE_0558] 
[LINE_0559] He looked uncomfortable. “This, I’m afraid, is the situation. Many of your fellow villagers are 
[LINE_0560] facing the same dilemma, I fear.” 
[LINE_0561] 
[LINE_0562] “If we leave, will we get our home back?” Isabelle asked. 
[LINE_0563] 
[LINE_0564] “I would not think so, Madame.” 
[LINE_0565] 
[LINE_0566] Vianne dared to take a step toward him. Perhaps she could reason with him. “My husband will be 
[LINE_0567] home any day now, I imagine. Perhaps you could wait until he is here?” 
[LINE_0568] 
[LINE_0569] “I am not the general, alas. I am simply a captain in the Wehrmacht. I follow orders, Madame, I do 
[LINE_0570] not give them. And I am ordered to billet here. But I assure you that I am a gentleman.” 
[LINE_0571] 
[LINE_0572] “We will leave,” Isabelle said. 
[LINE_0573] 
[LINE_0574] “Leave?” Vianne said to her sister in disbelief. “This is my home.” To the captain she said, “I can 
[LINE_0575] 
[LINE_0576] 
[LINE_0577] 
[LINE_0578] 
[LINE_0579] count on you to be a gentleman?” 
[LINE_0580] 
[LINE_0581] “Of course.” 
[LINE_0582] 
[LINE_0583] Vianne looked at Isabelle, who shook her head slowly. 
[LINE_0584] 
[LINE_0585] Vianne knew there was no real choice. She had to keep Sophie safe until Antoine came home, and 
[LINE_0586] then he would handle this unpleasantness. Surely he would be home soon, now that the armistice had 
[LINE_0587] been signed. “There is a small bedroom downstairs. You’ll be comfortable there.” 
[LINE_0588] 
[LINE_0589] The captain nodded. “Merci, Madame. I will get my things.” 
[LINE_0590] 
[LINE_0591] * * * 
[LINE_0592] 
[LINE_0593] As soon as the door closed behind the captain, Isabelle said, “Are you mad? We can’t live with a Nazi.” 
[LINE_0594] 
[LINE_0595] “He said he’s in the Wehrmacht. Is that the same thing?” 
[LINE_0596] 
[LINE_0597] “I’m hardly interested in their chain of command. You haven’t seen what they’re willing to do to us, 
[LINE_0598] Vianne. I have. We’ll leave. Go next door, to Rachel’s. We could live with her.” 
[LINE_0599] 
[LINE_0600] “Rachel’s house is too small for all of us, and I am not going to abandon my home to the Germans.” 
[LINE_0601] 
[LINE_0602] To that, Isabelle had no answer. 
[LINE_0603] 
[LINE_0604] Vianne felt anxiety turn to an itch along her throat. An old nervous habit returned. “You go if you 
[LINE_0605] must, but I am waiting for Antoine. We have surrendered, so he’ll be home soon.” 
[LINE_0606] 
[LINE_0607] “Vianne, please — ” 
[LINE_0608] 
[LINE_0609] The front door rattled hard. Another knock. 
[LINE_0610] 
[LINE_0611] Vianne walked dully forward. With a shaking hand, she reached for the knob and opened the door. 
[LINE_0612] 
[LINE_0613] Captain Beck stood there, holding his military hat in one hand and a small leather valise in the other. 
[LINE_0614] He said, “Hello again, Madame,” as if he’d been gone for some time. 
[LINE_0615] 
[LINE_0616] Vianne scratched at her neck, feeling acutely vulnerable beneath this man’s gaze. She backed away 
[LINE_0617] quickly, saying, “This way, Herr Captain.” 
[LINE_0618] 
[LINE_0619] As she turned, she saw the living room that had been decorated by three generations of her family’s 
[LINE_0620] women. Golden stucco walls, the color of freshly baked brioche, gray stone floors covered by ancient 
[LINE_0621] Aubusson rugs, heavily carved wooden furniture upholstered in mohair and tapestry fabric, lamps made 
[LINE_0622] of porcelain, curtains of gold and red toile, antiques and treasures left over from the years when the 
[LINE_0623] Rossignols had been wealthy tradesmen. Until recently there had been artwork on the walls. Now only 
[LINE_0624] the unimportant pieces remained. Isabelle had hidden the good ones. 
[LINE_0625] 
[LINE_0626] Vianne walked past all of it to the small guest bedroom tucked beneath the stairs. At the closed door, 
[LINE_0627] to the left of the bathroom that had been added in the early twenties, she paused. She could hear him 
[LINE_0628] breathing behind her. 
[LINE_0629] 
[LINE_0630] She opened the door to reveal a narrow room with a large window, bracketed by blue-gray curtains 
[LINE_0631] that pooled on the wooden floor. A painted chest of drawers supported a blue pitcher and ewer. In the 
[LINE_0632] corner was an aged oak armoire with mirrored doors. By the double bed sat a nightstand; on it, an 
[LINE_0633] antique ormolu clock. Isabelle’s clothes lay everywhere, as if she were packing for an extended holiday. 
[LINE_0634] Vianne picked them up quickly, and the valise, too. When she finished, she turned. 
[LINE_0635] 
[LINE_0636] 
[LINE_0637] 
[LINE_0638] 
[LINE_0639] His suitcase plunked to the floor. She looked at him, compelled by simple politeness to offer a tense 
[LINE_0640] smile. 
[LINE_0641] 
[LINE_0642] “You needn’t worry, Madame,” he said. “We have been admonished to act as gentlemen. My mother 
[LINE_0643] would demand the same, and, in truth, she scares me more than my general.” It was such an ordinary 
[LINE_0644] remark that Vianne was taken aback. 
[LINE_0645] 
[LINE_0646] She had no idea how to respond to this stranger who dressed like the enemy and looked like a young 
[LINE_0647] man she might have met at church. And what was the price for saying the wrong thing? 
[LINE_0648] 
[LINE_0649] He remained where he was, a respectful distance from her. “I apologize for any inconvenience, 
[LINE_0650] Madame.” 
[LINE_0651] 
[LINE_0652] “My husband will be home soon.” 
[LINE_0653] 
[LINE_0654] “We all hope to be home soon.” 
[LINE_0655] 
[LINE_0656] Another unnerving comment. Vianne nodded politely and left him alone in the room, closing the 
[LINE_0657] door behind her. 
[LINE_0658] 
[LINE_0659] “Tell me he’s not staying,” Isabelle said, rushing at her. 
[LINE_0660] 
[LINE_0661] “He says he is,” Vianne said tiredly, pushing back the hair from her eyes. She realized just now that 
[LINE_0662] she was trembling. “I know how you feel about these Nazis. Just make sure he doesn’t know it. I won’t 
[LINE_0663] let you put Sophie at risk with your childish rebellion.” 
[LINE_0664] 
[LINE_0665] “Childish rebellion! Are you — ” 
[LINE_0666] 
[LINE_0667] The guest room door opened, silencing Isabelle. 
[LINE_0668] 
[LINE_0669] Captain Beck strode confidently toward them, smiling broadly. Then he saw the radio in the room 
[LINE_0670] and he paused. “Do not worry, ladies. I am most pleased to deliver your radio to the Kommandant.” 
[LINE_0671] “Really?” Isabelle said. “You consider this a kindness?” 
[LINE_0672] 
[LINE_0673] Vianne felt a tightening in her chest. There was a storm brewing in Isabelle. Her sister’s cheeks had 
[LINE_0674] gone pale, her lips were drawn in a thin, colorless line, her eyes were narrowed. She was glaring at the 
[LINE_0675] German as if she could kill him with a look. 
[LINE_0676] 
[LINE_0677] “Of course.” He smiled, looking a little confused. The sudden silence seemed to unnerve him. 
[LINE_0678] Suddenly he said, “You have beautiful hair, M’mselle.” At Isabelle’s frown, he said, “This is an 
[LINE_0679] appropriate compliment, yes?” 
[LINE_0680] 
[LINE_0681] “Do you think so?” Isabelle said, her voice low. 
[LINE_0682] 
[LINE_0683] “Quite lovely.” Beck smiled. 
[LINE_0684] 
[LINE_0685] Isabelle walked into the kitchen and came back with a pair of boning shears. 
[LINE_0686] 
[LINE_0687] His smile faded. “Am I misunderstood?” 
[LINE_0688] 
[LINE_0689] Vianne said, “Isabelle, don’t,” just as Isabelle gathered up her thick blond hair and fisted it. Staring 
[LINE_0690] grimly at Captain Beck’s handsome face, she hacked off her hair and handed the long blond tail to him. 
[LINE_0691] “It must be verboten for us to have anything beautiful, is it not, Captain Beck?” 
[LINE_0692] 
[LINE_0693] Vianne gasped. “Please, sir. Ignore her. Isabelle is a silly, prideful girl.” 
[LINE_0694] 
[LINE_0695] “No,” Beck said. “She is angry. And angry people make mistakes in war and die.” 
[LINE_0696] 
[LINE_0697] “So do conquering soldiers,” Isabelle snapped. 
[LINE_0698] 
[LINE_0699] 
[LINE_0700] 
[LINE_0701] 
[LINE_0702] Beck laughed at her. 
[LINE_0703] 
[LINE_0704] Isabelle made a sound that was practically a snarl and pivoted on her heel. She marched up the stairs 
[LINE_0705] and slammed the door shut so hard the house shook. 
[LINE_0706] 
[LINE_0707] * * * 
[LINE_0708] 
[LINE_0709] “You will want to speak to her now, I warrant,” Beck said. He looked at Vianne in a way that made it 
[LINE_0710] seem as if they understood each other. “Such . . . theatrics in the wrong place could be most dangerous.” 
[LINE_0711] 
[LINE_0712] Vianne left him standing in her living room and went upstairs. She found Isabelle sitting on Sophie’s 
[LINE_0713] bed, so angry she was shaking. 
[LINE_0714] 
[LINE_0715] Scratches marred her cheeks and throat; a reminder of what she’d seen and survived. And now her 
[LINE_0716] hair was hacked off, the ends uneven. 
[LINE_0717] 
[LINE_0718] Vianne tossed Isabelle’s belongings onto the unmade bed and closed the door behind her. “What in 
[LINE_0719] the name of all that’s holy were you thinking?” 
[LINE_0720] 
[LINE_0721] “I could kill him in his sleep, just slit his throat.” 
[LINE_0722] 
[LINE_0723] “And do you think they would not come looking for a captain who had orders to billet here? Mon 
[LINE_0724] Dieu, Isabelle.” She took a deep breath to calm her racing nerves. “I know there are problems between 
[LINE_0725] us, Isabelle. I know I treated you badly as a child — I was too young and scared to help you — and Papa 
[LINE_0726] treated you worse. But this is not about us now, and you can’t be the girl who acts impetuously 
[LINE_0727] anymore. It is about my daughter now. Your niece. We must protect her.” 
[LINE_0728] 
[LINE_0729] “But—” 
[LINE_0730] 
[LINE_0731] “France has surrendered, Isabelle. Certainly this fact has not escaped you.” 
[LINE_0732] 
[LINE_0733] “Didn’t you hear General de Gaulle? He said — ” 
[LINE_0734] 
[LINE_0735] “And who is this General de Gaulle? Why should we listen to him? Marechal Petain is a war hero 
[LINE_0736] and our leader. We have to trust our government.” 
[LINE_0737] 
[LINE_0738] “Are you joking, Vianne? The government in Vichy is collaborating with Hitler. How can you not 
[LINE_0739] understand this danger? Petain is wrong. Does one follow a leader blindly?” 
[LINE_0740] 
[LINE_0741] Vianne moved toward Isabelle slowly, half afraid of her now. “You don’t remember the last war,” 
[LINE_0742] she said, clasping her hands to still them. “I do. I remember the fathers and brothers and uncles who 
[LINE_0743] didn’t come home. I remember hearing children in my class cry quietly when bad news came by 
[LINE_0744] telegram. I remember the men who came home on crutches, their pant legs empty and flapping, or an 
[LINE_0745] arm gone, or a face mined. I remember how Papa was before the war — and how different he was when
