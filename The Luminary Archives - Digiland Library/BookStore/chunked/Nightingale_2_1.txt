[LINE_0008] — Sir Edward Grey, on World War I 
[LINE_0009] 
[LINE_0010] 
[LINE_0011] 
[LINE_0012] August 1939 
[LINE_0013] France 
[LINE_0014] 
[LINE_0015] Vianne Mauriac left the cool, stucco-walled kitchen and stepped out into her front yard. On this 
[LINE_0016] beautiful summer morning in the Loire Valley, everything was in bloom. White sheets flapped in the 
[LINE_0017] breeze and roses tumbled like laughter along the ancient stone wall that hid her property from the road. 
[LINE_0018] A pair of industrious bees buzzed among the blooms; from far away, she heard the chugging purr of a 
[LINE_0019] train and then the sweet sound of a little girl’s laughter. 
[LINE_0020] 
[LINE_0021] Sophie. 
[LINE_0022] 
[LINE_0023] Vianne smiled. Her eight-year-old daughter was probably running through the house, making her 
[LINE_0024] father dance attendance on her as they readied for their Saturday picnic. 
[LINE_0025] 
[LINE_0026] “Your daughter is a tyre =]” Antoine said, appearing in the doorway. 
[LINE_0027] 
[LINE_0028] He walked toward her, his pomaded hair glinting black in the sunlight. He’d been working on his 
[LINE_0029] furniture this morning — sanding a chair that was already as soft as satin — and a fine layer of wood dust 
[LINE_0030] peppered his face and shoulders. He was a big man, tall and broad shouldered, with a rough face and a 
[LINE_0031] dark stubble that took constant effort to keep from becoming a beard. 
[LINE_0032] 
[LINE_0033] He slipped an arm around her and pulled her close. “I love you, V.” 
[LINE_0034] 
[LINE_0035] “I love you, too.” 
[LINE_0036] 
[LINE_0037] It was the truest fact of her world. She loved everything about this man, his smile, the way he 
[LINE_0038] mumbled in his sleep and laughed after a sneeze and sang opera in the shower. 
[LINE_0039] 
[LINE_0040] She’d fallen in love with him fifteen years ago, on the school play yard, before she’d even known 
[LINE_0041] what love was. He was her first everything — first kiss, first love, first lover. Before him, she’d been a 
[LINE_0042] skinny, awkward, anxious girl given to stuttering when she got scared, which was often. 
[LINE_0043] 
[LINE_0044] A motherless girl. 
[LINE_0045] 
[LINE_0046] You will be the adult now, her father had said to Vianne as they walked up to this very house for the 
[LINE_0047] first time. She’d been fourteen years old, her eyes swollen from crying, her grief unbearable. In an 
[LINE_0048] instant, this house had gone from being the family’s summer house to a prison of sorts. Maman had 
[LINE_0049] been dead less than two weeks when Papa gave up on being a father. Upon their arrival here, he’d not 
[LINE_0050] 
[LINE_0051] 
[LINE_0052] 
[LINE_0053] held her hand or rested a hand on her shoulder or even offered her a handkerchief to dry her tears. 
[LINE_0054] 
[LINE_0055] B-but I’m just a girl, she’d said. 
[LINE_0056] 
[LINE_0057] Not anymore. 
[LINE_0058] 
[LINE_0059] She’d looked down at her younger sister, Isabelle, who still sucked her thumb at four and had no 
[LINE_0060] idea what was going on. Isabelle kept asking when Maman was coming home. 
[LINE_0061] 
[LINE_0062] When the door opened, a tall, thin woman with a nose like a water spigot and eyes as small and dark 
[LINE_0063] as raisins appeared. 
[LINE_0064] 
[LINE_0065] These are the girls? the woman had said. 
[LINE_0066] 
[LINE_0067] Papa nodded. 
[LINE_0068] 
[LINE_0069] They will be no trouble. 
[LINE_0070] 
[LINE_0071] It had happened so fast. Vianne hadn’t really understood. Papa dropped off his daughters like soiled 
[LINE_0072] laundry and left them with a stranger. The girls were so far apart in age it was as if they were from 
[LINE_0073] different families. Vianne had wanted to comfort Isabelle — meant to — but Vianne had been in so much 
[LINE_0074] pain it was impossible to think of anyone else, especially a child as willful and impatient and loud as 
[LINE_0075] Isabelle. Vianne still remembered those first days here: Isabelle shrieking and Madame spanking her. 
[LINE_0076] Vianne had pleaded with her sister, saying, again and again, Mon Dieu, Isabelle, quit screeching. Just do 
[LINE_0077] as she bids, but even at four, Isabelle had been unmanageable. 
[LINE_0078] 
[LINE_0079] Vianne had been undone by all of it — the grief for her dead mother, the pain of her father’s 
[LINE_0080] abandonment, the sudden change in their circumstances, and Isabelle’s cloying, needy loneliness. 
[LINE_0081] 
[LINE_0082] It was Antoine who’d saved Vianne. That first summer after Maman’s death, the two of them had 
[LINE_0083] become inseparable. With him, Vianne had found an escape. By the time she was sixteen, she was 
[LINE_0084] pregnant; at seventeen, she was married and the mistress of Le Jardin. Two months later, she had a 
[LINE_0085] miscarriage and she lost herself for a while. There was no other way to put it. She’d crawled into her 
[LINE_0086] grief and cocooned it around her, unable to care about anyone or anything — certainly not a needy, 
[LINE_0087] wailing four-year-old sister. 
[LINE_0088] 
[LINE_0089] But that was old news. Not the sort of memory she wanted on a beautiful day like today. 
[LINE_0090] 
[LINE_0091] She leaned against her husband as their daughter ran up to them, announcing, “I’m ready. Let’s go.” 
[LINE_0092] 
[LINE_0093] “Well,” Antoine said, grinning. “The princess is ready and so we must move.” 
[LINE_0094] 
[LINE_0095] Vianne smiled as she went back into the house and retrieved her hat from the hook by the door. A 
[LINE_0096] strawberry blonde, with porcelain-thin skin and sea-blue eyes, she always protected herself from the 
[LINE_0097] sun. By the time she’d settled the wide-brimmed straw hat in place and collected her lacy gloves and 
[LINE_0098] picnic basket, Sophie and Antoine were already outside the gate. 
[LINE_0099] 
[LINE_0100] Vianne joined them on the dirt road in front of their home. It was barely wide enough for an 
[LINE_0101] automobile. Beyond it stretched acres of hayfields, the green here and there studded with red poppies 
[LINE_0102] and blue cornflowers. Forests grew in patches. In this corner of the Loire Valley, fields were more likely 
[LINE_0103] to be growing hay than grapes. Although less than two hours from Paris by train, it felt like a different 
[LINE_0104] world altogether. Few tourists visited, even in the summer. 
[LINE_0105] 
[LINE_0106] Now and then an automobile rumbled past, or a bicyclist, or an ox-driven cart, but for the most part, 
[LINE_0107] 
[LINE_0108] 
[LINE_0109] 
[LINE_0110] 
[LINE_0111] they were alone on the road. They lived nearly a mile from Carriveau, a town of less than a thousand 
[LINE_0112] souls that was known mostly as a stopping point on the pilgrimage of Ste. Jeanne d’Arc. There was no 
[LINE_0113] industry in town and few jobs — except for those at the airfield that was the pride of Carriveau. The only 
[LINE_0114] one of its kind for miles. 
[LINE_0115] 
[LINE_0116] In town, narrow cobblestoned streets wound through ancient limestone buildings that leaned 
[LINE_0117] clumsily against one another. Mortar crumbled from stone walls, ivy hid the decay that lay beneath, 
[LINE_0118] unseen but always felt. The village had been cobbled together piecemeal — crooked streets, uneven 
[LINE_0119] steps, blind alleys — over hundreds of years. Colors enlivened the stone buildings: red awnings ribbed in 
[LINE_0120] black metal, ironwork balconies decorated with geraniums in terra-cotta planters. Everywhere there was 
[LINE_0121] something to tempt the eye: a display case of pastel macarons, rough willow baskets filled with cheese 
[LINE_0122] and ham and saucisson, crates of colorful tomatoes and aubergines and cucumbers. The cafes were full 
[LINE_0123] on this sunny day. Men sat around metal tables, drinking coffee and smoking hand-rolled brown 
[LINE_0124] cigarettes and arguing loudly. 
[LINE_0125] 
[LINE_0126] A typical day in Carriveau. Monsieur LaChoa was sweeping the street in front of his saladerie, and 
[LINE_0127] Madame Clonet was washing the window of her hat shop, and a pack of adolescent boys was strolling 
[LINE_0128] through town, shoulder to shoulder, kicking bits of trash and passing a cigarette back and forth. 
[LINE_0129] 
[LINE_0130] At the end of town, they turned toward the river. At a flat, grassy spot along the shore, Vianne set 
[LINE_0131] down her basket and spread out a blanket in the shade of a chestnut tree. From the picnic basket, she 
[LINE_0132] withdrew a crusty baguette, a wedge of rich, double-cream cheese, two apples, some slices of paper-thin 
[LINE_0133] Bayonne ham, and a bottle of Bollinger ’36. She poured her husband a glass of champagne and sat 
[LINE_0134] down beside him as Sophie ran toward the riverbank. 
[LINE_0135] 
[LINE_0136] The day passed in a haze of sunshine-warmed contentment. They talked and laughed and shared 
[LINE_0137] their picnic. It wasn’t until late in the day, when Sophie was off with her fishing pole and Antoine was 
[LINE_0138] making their daughter a crown of daisies, that he said, “Hitler will suck us all into his war soon.” 
[LINE_0139] 
[LINE_0140] War. 
[LINE_0141] 
[LINE_0142] It was all anyone could talk about these days, and Vianne didn’t want to hear it. Especially not on 
[LINE_0143] this lovely summer day. 
[LINE_0144] 
[LINE_0145] She tented a hand across her eyes and stared at her daughter. Beyond the river, the green Loire 
[LINE_0146] Valley lay cultivated with care and precision. There were no fences, no boundaries, just miles of rolling 
[LINE_0147] green fields and patches of trees and the occasional stone house or barn. Tiny white blossoms floated 
[LINE_0148] like bits of cotton in the air. 
[LINE_0149] 
[LINE_0150] She got to her feet and clapped her hands. “Come, Sophie. It’s time to go home.” 
[LINE_0151] 
[LINE_0152] “You can’t ignore this, Vianne.” 
[LINE_0153] 
[LINE_0154] “Should I look for trouble? Why? You are here to protect us.” 
[LINE_0155] 
[LINE_0156] Smiling (too brightly, perhaps), she packed up the picnic and gathered her family and led them back 
[LINE_0157] to the dirt road. 
[LINE_0158] 
[LINE_0159] In less than thirty minutes, they were at the sturdy wooden gate of Le Jardin, the stone country 
[LINE_0160] house that had been in her family for three hundred years. Aged to a dozen shades of gray, it was a two- 
[LINE_0161] 
[LINE_0162] 
[LINE_0163] 
[LINE_0164] 
[LINE_0165] story house with blue-shuttered windows that overlooked the orchard. Ivy climbed up the two chimneys 
[LINE_0166] and covered the bricks beneath. Only seven acres of the original parcel were left. The other two hundred 
[LINE_0167] had been sold off over the course of two centuries as her family’s fortune dwindled. Seven acres was 
[LINE_0168] plenty for Vianne. She couldn’t imagine needing more. 
[LINE_0169] 
[LINE_0170] Vianne closed the door behind them. In the kitchen, copper and cast-iron pots and pans hung from 
[LINE_0171] an iron rack above the stove. Lavender and rosemary and thyme hung in drying bunches from the 
[LINE_0172] exposed timber beams of the ceiling. A copper sink, green with age, was big enough to bathe a small 
[LINE_0173] dog in. 
[LINE_0174] 
[LINE_0175] The plaster on the interior walls was peeling here and there to reveal paint from years gone by. The 
[LINE_0176] living room was an eclectic mix of furniture and fabrics — tapestried settee, Aubusson rugs, antique 
[LINE_0177] Chinese porcelain, chintz and toile. Some of the paintings on the wall were excellent — perhaps 
[LINE_0178] important — and some were amateurish. It had the jumbled, cobbled-together look of lost money and 
[LINE_0179] bygone taste — a little shabby, but comfortable. 
[LINE_0180] 
[LINE_0181] She paused in the salon, glancing through the glass-paned doors that led to the backyard, where 
[LINE_0182] Antoine was pushing Sophie on the swing he’d made for her. 
[LINE_0183] 
[LINE_0184] Vianne hung her hat gently on the hook by the door and retrieved her apron, tying it in place. While 
[LINE_0185] Sophie and Antoine played outside, Vianne cooked supper. She wrapped a pink pork tenderloin in thick- 
[LINE_0186] cut bacon, tied it in twine, and browned it in hot oil. While the pork roasted in the oven, she made the 
[LINE_0187] rest of the meal. At eight o’clock — right on time — she called everyone to supper and couldn’t help 
[LINE_0188] smiling at the thundering of feet and the chatter of conversation and the squealing of chair legs scraping 
[LINE_0189] across the floor as they sat down. 
[LINE_0190] 
[LINE_0191] Sophie sat at the head of the table, wearing the crown of daisies Antoine had made for her at the 
[LINE_0192] riverbank. 
[LINE_0193] 
[LINE_0194] Vianne set down the platter. A delicious fragrance wafted upward — roasted pork and crispy bacon 
[LINE_0195] and apples glazed in a rich wine sauce, resting on a bed of browned potatoes. Beside it was a bowl of 
[LINE_0196] fresh peas, swimming in butter seasoned with tarragon from the garden. And of course there was the 
[LINE_0197] baguette Vianne had made yesterday morning. 
[LINE_0198] 
[LINE_0199] As always, Sophie talked all through supper. She was like her Tante Isabelle in that way — a girl who 
[LINE_0200] couldn’t hold her tongue. 
[LINE_0201] 
[LINE_0202] When at last they came to dessert — He flottante, islands of toasted meringue floating in a rich creme 
[LINE_0203] anglaise — there was a satisfied silence around the table. 
[LINE_0204] 
[LINE_0205] “Well,” Vianne said at last, pushing her half-empty dessert plate away, “it’s time to do the dishes.” 
[LINE_0206] 
[LINE_0207] “Ahh, Maman,” Sophie whined. 
[LINE_0208] 
[LINE_0209] “No whining,” Antoine said. “Not at your age.” 
[LINE_0210] 
[LINE_0211] Vianne and Sophie went into the kitchen, as they did each night, to their stations — Vianne at the 
[LINE_0212] deep copper sink, Sophie at the stone counter — and began washing and drying the dishes. Vianne could 
[LINE_0213] smell the sweet, sharp scent of Antoine’s after-supper cigarette wafting through the house. 
[LINE_0214] 
[LINE_0215] “Papa didn’t laugh at a single one of my stories today,” Sophie said as Vianne placed the dishes back 
[LINE_0216] 
[LINE_0217] 
[LINE_0218] 
[LINE_0219] 
[LINE_0220] in the rough wooden rack that hung on the wall. “Something is wrong with him.” 
[LINE_0221] 
[LINE_0222] “No laughter? Well, certainly that is cause for alarm.” 
[LINE_0223] 
[LINE_0224] “He’s worried about the war.” 
[LINE_0225] 
[LINE_0226] The war. Again. 
[LINE_0227] 
[LINE_0228] Vianne shooed her daughter out of the kitchen. Upstairs, in Sophie’s bedroom, Vianne sat on the 
[LINE_0229] double bed, listening to her daughter chatter as she put on her pajamas and brushed her teeth and got 
[LINE_0230] into bed. 
[LINE_0231] 
[LINE_0232] Vianne leaned down to kiss her good night. 
[LINE_0233] 
[LINE_0234] “I’m scared,” Sophie said. “Is war coming?” 
[LINE_0235] 
[LINE_0236] “Don’t be afraid,” Vianne said. “Papa will protect us.” But even as she said it, she remembered 
[LINE_0237] another time, when her maman had said to her, Don ’t be afraid. 
[LINE_0238] 
[LINE_0239] It was when her own father had gone off to war. 
[LINE_0240] 
[LINE_0241] Sophie looked unconvinced. “But — ” 
[LINE_0242] 
[LINE_0243] “But nothing. There is nothing to worry about. Now go to sleep.” 
[LINE_0244] 
[LINE_0245] She kissed her daughter again, letting her lips linger on the little girl’s cheek. 
[LINE_0246] 
[LINE_0247] Vianne went down the stairs and headed for the backyard. Outside, the night was sultry; the air 
[LINE_0248] smelled of jasmine. She found Antoine sitting in one of the iron cafe chairs out on the grass, his legs 
[LINE_0249] stretched out, his body slumped uncomfortably to one side. 
[LINE_0250] 
[LINE_0251] She came up beside him, put a hand on his shoulder. He exhaled smoke and took another long drag 
[LINE_0252] on the cigarette. Then he looked up at her. In the moonlight, his face appeared pale and shadowed. 
[LINE_0253] Almost unfamiliar. He reached into the pocket of his vest and pulled out a piece of paper. “I have been 
[LINE_0254] mobilized, Vianne. Along with most men between eighteen and thirty-five.” 
[LINE_0255] 
[LINE_0256] “Mobilized? But ... we are not at war. I don’t — ” 
[LINE_0257] 
[LINE_0258] “I am to report for duty on Tuesday.” 
[LINE_0259] 
[LINE_0260] “But ... but ... you’re a postman.” 
[LINE_0261] 
[LINE_0262] He held her gaze and suddenly she couldn’t breathe. “I am a soldier now, it seems.”
