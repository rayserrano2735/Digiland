[LINE_0001] EIGHT 
[LINE_0002] 
[LINE_0003] 
[LINE_0004] 
[LINE_0005] The surrender was a bitter pill to swallow, but Marechal Petain was an honorable man. A hero of the last 
[LINE_0006] war with Germany. Yes, he was old, but Vianne shared the belief that this only gave him a better 
[LINE_0007] perspective from which to judge their circumstances. He had fashioned a way for their men to come 
[LINE_0008] home, so it wouldn’t be like the Great War. 
[LINE_0009] 
[LINE_0010] Vianne understood what Isabelle could not: Petain had surrendered on behalf of France to save lives 
[LINE_0011] and preserve their nation and their way of life. It was true that the terms of this surrender were difficult: 
[LINE_0012] France had been divided into two zones. The Occupied Zone — the northern half of the country and the 
[LINE_0013] coastal regions (including Carriveau) — was to be taken over and governed by the Nazis. The great 
[LINE_0014] middle of the country, the land that lay below Paris and above the sea, would be the Free Zone, 
[LINE_0015] governed by a new French government in Vichy, led by Marechal Petain himself, in collaboration with 
[LINE_0016] the Nazis. 
[LINE_0017] 
[LINE_0018] Immediately upon France’s surrender, food became scarce. Laundry soap: unobtainable. Ration 
[LINE_0019] cards could not be counted upon. Phone service became unreliable, as did the mail. The Nazis 
[LINE_0020] effectively cut off communication between cities and towns. The only mail allowed was on official 
[LINE_0021] German postcards. But for Vianne, these were not the worst of the changes. 
[LINE_0022] 
[LINE_0023] Isabelle became impossible to live with. Several times since the surrender, while Vianne toiled to 
[LINE_0024] reconstruct and replant her garden and repair her damaged fruit trees, she had paused in her work and 
[LINE_0025] seen Isabelle standing at the gate staring up at the sky as if some dark and horrible thing were headed 
[LINE_0026] this way. 
[LINE_0027] 
[LINE_0028] All Isabelle could talk about was the monstrosity of the Nazis and their determination to kill the 
[LINE_0029] French. She had no ability — of course — to hold her tongue, and since Vianne refused to listen, Sophie 
[LINE_0030] became Isabelle’s audience, her acolyte. She filled poor Sophie’s head with terrible images of what 
[LINE_0031] would happen, so much so that the child had nightmares. Vianne dared not leave the two of them alone, 
[LINE_0032] and so today, like each of the previous days, she made them both come to town with her to see what 
[LINE_0033] their ration cards would get them. 
[LINE_0034] 
[LINE_0035] They had been standing in a food queue at the butcher’s shop for two hours already. Isabelle had 
[LINE_0036] been complaining nearly that whole time. Apparently it made no sense to her that she should have to 
[LINE_0037] shop for food. 
[LINE_0038] 
[LINE_0039] 
[LINE_0040] 
[LINE_0041] “Vianne, look,” Isabelle said. 
[LINE_0042] 
[LINE_0043] More dramatics. 
[LINE_0044] 
[LINE_0045] “Vianne. Look.” 
[LINE_0046] 
[LINE_0047] She turned — just to silence her sister — and saw them. 
[LINE_0048] 
[LINE_0049] Germans. 
[LINE_0050] 
[LINE_0051] Up and down the street, windows and doors slammed shut. People disappeared so quickly Vianne 
[LINE_0052] found herself suddenly standing alone on the sidewalk with her sister and daughter. She grabbed Sophie 
[LINE_0053] and pulled her against the butcher shop’s closed door. 
[LINE_0054] 
[LINE_0055] Isabelle stepped defiantly into the street. 
[LINE_0056] 
[LINE_0057] “Isabelle,” Vianne hissed, but Isabelle stood her ground, her green eyes bright with hatred, her pale, 
[LINE_0058] fine-boned beautiful face marred by scratches and bruises. 
[LINE_0059] 
[LINE_0060] The green lorry in the lead came to a halt in front of Isabelle. In the back, soldiers sat on benches, 
[LINE_0061] facing one another, rifles laid casually across their laps. They looked young and clean shaven and eager 
[LINE_0062] in brand-new helmets, with medals glinting on their gray-green uniforms. Young most of all. Not 
[LINE_0063] monsters; just boys, really. They craned their necks to see what had stopped traffic. At the sight of 
[LINE_0064] Isabelle standing there, the soldiers started to smile and wave. 
[LINE_0065] 
[LINE_0066] Vianne grabbed Isabelle’s hand and yanked her out of the way. 
[LINE_0067] 
[LINE_0068] The military entourage rumbled past them, a string of vehicles and motorcycles and lorries covered 
[LINE_0069] in camouflaged netting. Armored tanks rolled thunderously on the cobblestoned street. And then came 
[LINE_0070] the soldiers. 
[LINE_0071] 
[LINE_0072] Two long lines of them, marching into town. 
[LINE_0073] 
[LINE_0074] Isabelle walked boldly alongside them, up rue Victor Hugo. The Germans waved to her, looking 
[LINE_0075] more like tourists than conquerors. 
[LINE_0076] 
[LINE_0077] “Maman, you can’t let her go off by herself,” Sophie said. 
[LINE_0078] 
[LINE_0079] “Merde. ” Vianne clutched Sophie’s hand and ran after Isabelle. They caught up with her in the next 
[LINE_0080] block. 
[LINE_0081] 
[LINE_0082] The town square, usually full of people, had practically emptied. Only a few townspeople dared to 
[LINE_0083] remain as the German vehicles pulled up in front of the town hall and parked. 
[LINE_0084] 
[LINE_0085] An officer appeared — or Vianne assumed he was an officer because of the way he began barking 
[LINE_0086] orders. 
[LINE_0087] 
[LINE_0088] Soldiers marched around the large cobblestoned square, claiming it with their overwhelming 
[LINE_0089] presence. They ripped down the flag of France and replaced it with their Nazi flag: a huge black 
[LINE_0090] swastika against a red and black background. When it was in place, the troops stopped as one, extended 
[LINE_0091] their right arms, and yelled, “Heil Hitler. ” 
[LINE_0092] 
[LINE_0093] “If I had a gun,” Isabelle said, “I’d show them not all of us wanted to surrender.” 
[LINE_0094] 
[LINE_0095] “Shhh,” Vianne said. “You’ll get us all killed with that mouth of yours. Let’s go.” 
[LINE_0096] 
[LINE_0097] “No. I want — ” 
[LINE_0098] 
[LINE_0099] Vianne spun to face Isabelle. “Enough. You will not draw attention to us. Is that understood?” 
[LINE_0100] 
[LINE_0101] 
[LINE_0102] 
[LINE_0103] 
[LINE_0104] Isabelle gave one last hate-filled glance at the marching soldiers and then let Vianne lead her away. 
[LINE_0105] 
[LINE_0106] They slipped from the main street and entered a dark cleft in the walls that led to a back alley behind 
[LINE_0107] the milliner’s shop. They could hear the soldiers singing. Then a shot rang out. And another. Someone 
[LINE_0108] screamed. 
[LINE_0109] 
[LINE_0110] Isabelle stopped. 
[LINE_0111] 
[LINE_0112] “Don’t you dare,” Vianne said. “Move. ” 
[LINE_0113] 
[LINE_0114] They kept to the dark alleys, ducking into doorways when they heard voices coming their way. It 
[LINE_0115] took longer than usual to get through town, but eventually they made it to the dirt road. They walked 
[LINE_0116] silently past the cemetery and all the way home. Once inside, Vianne slammed the door behind her and 
[LINE_0117] locked it. 
[LINE_0118] 
[LINE_0119] “You see?” Isabelle said instantly. She had obviously been waiting to throw out the question. 
[LINE_0120] 
[LINE_0121] “Go to your room,” Vianne said to Sophie. Whatever Isabelle was going to say, she didn’t want 
[LINE_0122] Sophie to hear. Vianne eased the hat from her head and set down her empty basket. Her hands were 
[LINE_0123] shaking. 
[LINE_0124] 
[LINE_0125] “They’re here because of the airfield,” Isabelle said. She began pacing. “I didn’t think it would 
[LINE_0126] happen so fast, even with the surrender. I didn’t believe ... I thought our soldiers would fight anyway. I 
[LINE_0127] thought...” 
[LINE_0128] 
[LINE_0129] “Quit biting at your nails. You’ll make them bleed, you know.” 
[LINE_0130] 
[LINE_0131] Isabelle looked a madwoman, with her waist-length blond hair falling loose from its braid and her 
[LINE_0132] bruised face twisted with fury. “The Nazis are here, Vianne. In Carriveau. Their flag flies from the hotel 
[LINE_0133] de ville as it flies from the Arc du Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower. They weren’t in town five minutes 
[LINE_0134] and a shot was fired.” 
[LINE_0135] 
[LINE_0136] “The war is over, Isabelle. Marechal Petain said so.” 
[LINE_0137] 
[LINE_0138] “The war is over? The war is over? Did you see them back there, with their guns and their flags and 
[LINE_0139] their arrogance? We need to get out of here, V. We’ll take Sophie and leave Carriveau.” 
[LINE_0140] 
[LINE_0141] “And go where?” 
[LINE_0142] 
[LINE_0143] “Anywhere. Lyon, maybe. Provence. What was that town in the Dordogne where Maman was born? 
[LINE_0144] Brantome. We could find her friend, that Basque woman, what was her name? She might help us.” 
[LINE_0145] 
[LINE_0146] “You are giving me a headache.” 
[LINE_0147] 
[LINE_0148] “A headache is the least of your problems,” Isabelle said, pacing again. 
[LINE_0149] 
[LINE_0150] Vianne approached her. “You are not going to do anything crazy or stupid. Am I understood?” 
[LINE_0151] 
[LINE_0152] Isabelle growled in frustration and marched upstairs, slamming the door behind her. 
[LINE_0153] 
[LINE_0154] * * * 
[LINE_0155] 
[LINE_0156] 
[LINE_0157] 
[LINE_0158] Surrender. 
[LINE_0159] 
[LINE_0160] The word stuck in Isabelle’s thoughts. That night, as she lay in the downstairs guest bedroom, 
[LINE_0161] staring up at the ceiling, she felt frustration lodge in her so deeply she could hardly think straight. 
[LINE_0162] 
[LINE_0163] Was she supposed to spend the war in this house like some helpless girl, doing laundry and standing 
[LINE_0164] 
[LINE_0165] 
[LINE_0166] 
[LINE_0167] 
[LINE_0168] in food lines and sweeping the floor? Was she to stand by and watch the enemy take everything from 
[LINE_0169] France? 
[LINE_0170] 
[LINE_0171] She had always felt lonely and frustrated — or at least she had felt it for as long as she could 
[LINE_0172] remember — but never as sharply as now. She was stuck here in the country with no friends and nothing 
[LINE_0173] to do. 
[LINE_0174] 
[LINE_0175] No. 
[LINE_0176] 
[LINE_0177] There must be something she could do. Even here, even now. 
[LINE_0178] 
[LINE_0179] Hide the valuables. 
[LINE_0180] 
[LINE_0181] It was all that came to her. The Germans would loot the houses in town; of that she had no doubt, 
[LINE_0182] and when they did they would take everything of value. Her own government — cowards that they were 
[LINE_0183] — had known that. It was why they had emptied much of the Louvre and put fake paintings on the 
[LINE_0184] museum walls. 
[LINE_0185] 
[LINE_0186] “Not much of a plan,” she muttered. But it was better than nothing. 
[LINE_0187] 
[LINE_0188] The next day, as soon as Vianne and Sophie left for school, Isabelle began. She ignored Vianne ’s 
[LINE_0189] request that she go to town for food. She couldn’t stand to see the Nazis, and one day without meat 
[LINE_0190] would hardly matter. Instead, she searched the house, opening closets and rummaging through drawers 
[LINE_0191] and looking under the beds. She took every item of value and set it on the trestle table in the dining 
[LINE_0192] room. There were lots of valuable heirlooms. Lacework tatted by her great-grandmother, a set of 
[LINE_0193] sterling silver salt and pepper shakers, a gilt-edged Limoges platter that had been their aunt’s, several 
[LINE_0194] small impressionist paintings, a tablecloth made of fine ivory Alen^on lace, several photograph albums, 
[LINE_0195] a silver-framed photograph of Vianne and Antoine and baby Sophie, her mother’s pearls, Vianne ’s 
[LINE_0196] wedding dress and more. Isabelle boxed up everything that would fit in a wooden-trimmed leather 
[LINE_0197] trunk, which she dragged through the trampled grass, wincing every time it scraped on a stone or 
[LINE_0198] thudded into something. By the time she reached the barn, she was breathing hard and sweating. 
[LINE_0199] 
[LINE_0200] The barn was smaller than she remembered. The hayloft — once the only place in the world where 
[LINE_0201] she was happy — was really just a small tier on the second floor, a bit of floor perched at the top of a 
[LINE_0202] rickety ladder and beneath the roof, through which slats of sky could be seen. How many hours had she 
[LINE_0203] spent up there alone with her picture books, pretending that someone cared enough to come looking for 
[LINE_0204] her? Waiting for her sister, who was always out with Rachel or Antoine. 
[LINE_0205] 
[LINE_0206] She pushed that memory aside. 
[LINE_0207] 
[LINE_0208] The center of the barn was no more than thirty feet wide. It had been built by her great-grandfather 
[LINE_0209] to hold buggies — back when the family had money. Now there was only an old Renault parked in the 
[LINE_0210] center. The stalls were filled with tractor parts and web-draped wooden ladders and rusted farm 
[LINE_0211] implements. 
[LINE_0212] 
[LINE_0213] She closed the barn door and went to the automobile. The driver’s side door opened with a 
[LINE_0214] squeaking, clattering reluctance. She climbed in, started the engine, drove forward about eight feet, and 
[LINE_0215] then parked. 
[LINE_0216] 
[LINE_0217] The trapdoor was revealed now. About five feet long and four feet wide and made of planks 
[LINE_0218] 
[LINE_0219] 
[LINE_0220] 
[LINE_0221] 
[LINE_0222] connected by leather straps, the cellar door was nearly impossible to see, especially as it was now, 
[LINE_0223] covered in dust and old hay. She pulled the trapdoor open, letting it rest against the automobile’s 
[LINE_0224] dinged-up bumper, and peered down into the musty darkness. 
[LINE_0225] 
[LINE_0226] Holding the trunk by its strap, she turned on her torchlight and clamped it under her other armpit and 
[LINE_0227] climbed down the ladder slowly, clanking the trunk down, rung by rung, until she was at the bottom. 
[LINE_0228] The trunk clattered onto the dirt floor beside her. 
[LINE_0229] 
[LINE_0230] Like the loft, this hidey-hole had seemed bigger to her as a child. It was about eight feet wide and 
[LINE_0231] ten feet long, with shelving along one side and an old mattress on the floor. The shelves used to hold 
[LINE_0232] barrels for winemaking, but a lantern was the only thing left on the shelves. 
[LINE_0233] 
[LINE_0234] She tucked the trunk into the back corner and then went back to the house, where she gathered up 
[LINE_0235] some preserved food, blankets, some medical supplies, her father’s hunting shotgun, and a bottle of 
[LINE_0236] wine, all of which she put out on the shelves. 
[LINE_0237] 
[LINE_0238] When she climbed back up the ladder, she found Vianne in the barn. 
[LINE_0239] 
[LINE_0240] “What in the world are you doing out here?” 
[LINE_0241] 
[LINE_0242] Isabelle wiped her dusty hands on the worn cotton of her skirt. “Hiding your valuables and putting 
[LINE_0243] supplies down here — in case we need to hide from the Nazis. Come down and look. I did a good job, I 
[LINE_0244] think.” She backed down the ladder and Vianne followed her into the darkness. Lighting a lantern, 
[LINE_0245] Isabelle proudly showed off Papa’s shotgun and the foodstuffs and medical supplies. 
[LINE_0246] 
[LINE_0247] Vianne went straight to their mother’s jewelry box, opening it. 
[LINE_0248] 
[LINE_0249] Inside lay brooches and earrings and necklaces, mostly costume pieces. But at the bottom, lying on 
[LINE_0250] blue velvet, were the pearls that Grandmere had worn on her wedding day and given to Maman to wear 
[LINE_0251] on her wedding day. 
[LINE_0252] 
[LINE_0253] “You may need to sell them someday,” Isabelle said. 
[LINE_0254] 
[LINE_0255] Vianne clamped the box shut. “They are heirlooms, Isabelle. For Sophie’s wedding day — and yours. 
[LINE_0256] I would never sell them.” She sighed impatiently and turned to Isabelle. “What food were you able to 
[LINE_0257] get in town?” 
[LINE_0258] 
[LINE_0259] “I did this instead.” 
[LINE_0260] 
[LINE_0261] “Of course you did. It’s more important to hide Maman’s pearls than to feed your niece supper. 
[LINE_0262] Honestly, Isabelle.” Vianne climbed up the ladder, her displeasure revealed in tiny, disgusted huffs. 
[LINE_0263] 
[LINE_0264] Isabelle left the cellar and drove the Renault back into place over the door. Then she hid the keys 
[LINE_0265] behind a broken board in one of the stalls. At the last moment, she disabled the automobile by removing 
[LINE_0266] the distributor cap. She hid it with the keys. 
[LINE_0267] 
[LINE_0268] When she finally returned to the house, Vianne was in the kitchen, frying potatoes in a cast-iron 
[LINE_0269] skillet. “I hope you aren’t hungry.” 
[LINE_0270] 
[LINE_0271] “I’m not.” She moved past Vianne, barely making eye contact. “Oh, and I hid the keys and 
[LINE_0272] distributor cap in the first stall, behind a broken board.” In the living room, she turned on the radio and 
[LINE_0273] scooted close, hoping for news from the BBC. 
[LINE_0274] 
[LINE_0275] There was a staticky crackle and then an unfamiliar voice said, “This is the BBC. General de Gaulle 
[LINE_0276] 
[LINE_0277] 
[LINE_0278] 
[LINE_0279] 
[LINE_0280] is speaking to you.” 
[LINE_0281] 
[LINE_0282] “Vianne!” Isabelle yelled toward the kitchen. “Who is General de Gaulle?” 
[LINE_0283] 
[LINE_0284] Vianne came into the living room, drying her hands on her apron. “What is — ” 
[LINE_0285] 
[LINE_0286] “Shush,” Isabelle snapped. 
[LINE_0287] 
[LINE_0288] “... the leaders who have been at the head of the French army for many years have formed a 
[LINE_0289] government. On the pretext that our army has been defeated, this government has approached the enemy 
[LINE_0290] with a view to ceasing hostilities.” 
[LINE_0291] 
[LINE_0292] Isabelle stared at the small wooden radio, transfixed. This man they’d never heard of spoke directly 
[LINE_0293] to the people of France, not at them as Petain had done, but to them in an impassioned voice. “Pretext of 
[LINE_0294] defeat. I knew it!” 
[LINE_0295] 
[LINE_0296] “... we certainly have been, and still are, submerged by the mechanical strength of the enemy, both 
[LINE_0297] on land and in the air. The tanks, the aeroplanes, the tactics of the Germans astounded our generals to 
[LINE_0298] such an extent that they have been brought to the pain which they are in today. But has the last word 
[LINE_0299] been said? Has all hope disappeared? Is the defeat final?” 
[LINE_0300] 
[LINE_0301] “Mon Dieu,” Isabelle said. This was what she’d been waiting to hear. There was something to be 
[LINE_0302] done, a fight to engage in. The surrender wasn’t final. 
[LINE_0303] 
[LINE_0304] “Whatever happens,” de Gaulle’s voice went on, “the flame of French resistance must not and shall 
[LINE_0305] not die.” 
[LINE_0306] 
[LINE_0307] Isabelle hardly noticed that she was crying. The French hadn’t given up. Now all Isabelle had to do 
[LINE_0308] was figure out how to answer this call. 
[LINE_0309] 
[LINE_0310] 
[LINE_0311] 
[LINE_0312] * * * 
[LINE_0313] 
[LINE_0314] Two days after the Nazis occupied Carriveau, they called a meeting for the late afternoon. Everyone was 
[LINE_0315] to attend. No exceptions. Even so, Vianne had had to fight with Isabelle to get her to come. As usual, 
[LINE_0316] Isabelle did not think ordinary rules pertained to her and she wanted to use defiance to show her 
[LINE_0317] displeasure. As if the Nazis cared what one impetuous eighteen-year-old girl thought of their occupation 
[LINE_0318] of her country. 
[LINE_0319] 
[LINE_0320] “Wait here,” Vianne said impatiently when she’d finally gotten Isabelle and Sophie out of the house. 
[LINE_0321] She gently closed the broken gate behind them. It gave a little click of closure. 
[LINE_0322] 
[LINE_0323] Moments later, Rachel appeared in the road, coming toward them, with the baby in her arms and 
[LINE_0324] Sarah at her side. 
[LINE_0325] 
[LINE_0326] “That’s my best friend, Sarah,” Sophie said, gazing up at Isabelle. 
[LINE_0327] 
[LINE_0328] “Isabelle,” Rachel said with a smile. “It is good to see you again.” 
[LINE_0329] 
[LINE_0330] “Is it?” Isabelle said. 
[LINE_0331] 
[LINE_0332] Rachel moved closer to Isabelle. “That was a long time ago,” Rachel said gently. “We were young 
[LINE_0333] and stupid and selfish. I’m sorry we treated you badly. Ignored you. That must have been very painful.” 
[LINE_0334] Isabelle’s mouth opened, closed. For once, she had nothing to say. 
[LINE_0335] 
[LINE_0336] “Let’s go,” Vianne said, irritated that Rachel had said to Isabelle what Vianne had not been able to. 
[LINE_0337] 
[LINE_0338] 
[LINE_0339] 
[LINE_0340] 
[LINE_0341] “We shouldn’t be late.” 
[LINE_0342] 
[LINE_0343] Even this late in the day, the weather was unseasonably warm, and in no time, Vianne felt herself 
[LINE_0344] beginning to sweat. In town, they joined the grumbling crowd that filled the narrow cobblestoned street 
[LINE_0345] from storefront to storefront. The shops were closed and the windows were shuttered, even though the 
[LINE_0346] heat would be unbearable when they got home. Most of the display cases were empty, which was hardly 
[LINE_0347] surprising. The Germans ate so much; even worse, they left food on their plates in the cafes. Careless 
[LINE_0348] and cruel, it was, with so many mothers beginning to count the jars in their cellars so that they could 
[LINE_0349] dole out every precious bite to their children. Nazi propaganda was everywhere, on windows and shop 
[LINE_0350] walls; posters that showed smiling German soldiers surrounded by French children with captions 
[LINE_0351] designed to encourage the French to accept their conquerors and become good citizens of the Reich. 
[LINE_0352] 
[LINE_0353] As the crowd approached the town hall, the grumbling stopped. Up close, it felt even worse, this 
[LINE_0354] following of instructions, walking blindly into a place with guarded doors and locked windows. 
[LINE_0355] 
[LINE_0356] “We shouldn’t go in,” Isabelle said. 
[LINE_0357] 
[LINE_0358] Rachel, who stood between the sisters, towering over both of them, made a tsking sound. She 
[LINE_0359] resettled the baby in her arms, patting his back in a comforting rhythm. “We have been summoned.” 
[LINE_0360] 
[LINE_0361] “All the more reason to hide,” Isabelle said. 
[LINE_0362] 
[LINE_0363] “Sophie and I are going in,” Vianne said, although she had to admit that she felt a prickly sense of 
[LINE_0364] foreboding. 
[LINE_0365] 
[LINE_0366] “I have a bad feeling about it,” Isabelle muttered. 
[LINE_0367] 
[LINE_0368] Fike a thousand-legged centipede, the crowd moved forward into the great hall. Tapestries had once 
[LINE_0369] hung from these walls, leftover treasure from the time of kings, when the Foire Valley had been the 
[LINE_0370] royal hunting ground, but all that was gone now. Instead there were swastikas and propagandist posters 
[LINE_0371] on the walls — Trust in the Reich ! — and a huge painting of Hitler. 
[LINE_0372] 
[LINE_0373] Beneath the painting stood a man wearing a black field tunic decorated with medals and iron 
[LINE_0374] crosses, knee breeches, and spit-shined boots. A red swastika armband circled his right bicep.
