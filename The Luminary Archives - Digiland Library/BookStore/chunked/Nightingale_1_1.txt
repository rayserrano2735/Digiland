[LINE_0006] The Oregon Coast 
[LINE_0007] 
[LINE_0008] If I have learned anything in this long life of mine, it is this: In love we find out who we want to be; in 
[LINE_0009] war we find out who we are. Today’s young people want to know everything about everyone. They 
[LINE_0010] think talking about a problem will solve it. I come from a quieter generation. We understand the value 
[LINE_0011] of forgetting, the lure of reinvention. 
[LINE_0012] 
[LINE_0013] Lately, though, I find myself thinking about the war and my past, about the people I lost. 
[LINE_0014] 
[LINE_0015] Lost. 
[LINE_0016] 
[LINE_0017] It makes it sound as if I misplaced my loved ones; perhaps I left them where they don’t belong and 
[LINE_0018] then turned away, too confused to retrace my steps. 
[LINE_0019] 
[LINE_0020] They are not lost. Nor are they in a better place. They are gone. As I approach the end of my years, I 
[LINE_0021] know that grief, like regret, settles into our DNA and remains forever a part of us. 
[LINE_0022] 
[LINE_0023] I have aged in the months since my husband’s death and my diagnosis. My skin has the crinkled 
[LINE_0024] appearance of wax paper that someone has tried to flatten and reuse. My eyes fail me often — in the 
[LINE_0025] darkness, when headlights flash, when rain falls. It is unnerving, this new unreliability in my vision. 
[LINE_0026] Perhaps that’s why I find myself looking backward. The past has a clarity I can no longer see in the 
[LINE_0027] present. 
[LINE_0028] 
[LINE_0029] I want to imagine there will be peace when I am gone, that I will see all of the people I have loved 
[LINE_0030] and lost. At least that I will be forgiven. 
[LINE_0031] 
[LINE_0032] I know better, though, don’t I? 
[LINE_0033] 
[LINE_0034] 
[LINE_0035] 
[LINE_0036] * * * 
[LINE_0037] 
[LINE_0038] My house, named The Peaks by the lum 1 baron who built it more than a hundred years ago, is for 
[LINE_0039] sale, and I am preparing to move because my son thinks I should. 
[LINE_0040] 
[LINE_0041] He is trying to take care of me, to show how much he loves me in this most difficult of times, and so 
[LINE_0042] I put up with his controlling ways. What do I care where I die? That is the point, really. It no longer 
[LINE_0043] matters where I live. I am boxing up the Oregon beachside life I settled into nearly fifty years ago. 
[LINE_0044] There is not much I want to take with me. But there is one thing. 
[LINE_0045] 
[LINE_0046] I reach for the hanging handle that controls the attic steps. The stairs unfold from the ceiling like a 
[LINE_0047] gentleman extending his hand. 
[LINE_0048] 
[LINE_0049] The flimsy stairs wobble beneath my feet as I climb into the attic, which smells of must and mold. A 
[LINE_0050] 
[LINE_0051] 
[LINE_0052] 
[LINE_0053] single, hanging lightbulb swings overhead. I pull the cord. 
[LINE_0054] 
[LINE_0055] It is like being in the hold of an old steamship. Wide wooden planks panel the walls; cobwebs turn 
[LINE_0056] the creases silver and hang in skeins from the indentations between the planks. The ceiling is so steeply 
[LINE_0057] pitched that I can stand upright omy in the center of the room. 
[LINE_0058] 
[LINE_0059] I see the rocking chair I used when my grandchildren were young, then an old crib and a ratty- 
[LINE_0060] looking rocking horse set on rusty springs, and the chair my daughter was refinishing when she got sick. 
[LINE_0061] Boxes are tucked along the wall, marked “Xmas,” “Thanksgiving,” “Easter,” “Halloween,” 
[LINE_0062] “Serveware,” “Sports.” In those boxes are the things I don’t use much anymore but can’t bear to part 
[LINE_0063] with. For me, admitting that I won’t decorate a tree for Christmas is giving up, and I’ve never been good 
[LINE_0064] at letting go. Tucked in the corner is what I am looking for: an ancient steamer trunk covered in travel 
[LINE_0065] stickers. 
[LINE_0066] 
[LINE_0067] With effort, I drag the heavy trunk to the center of the attic, directly beneath the hanging light. I 
[LINE_0068] kneel beside it, but the pain in my knees is piercing, so I slide onto my backside. 
[LINE_0069] 
[LINE_0070] For the first time in thirty years, I lift the tmnk’s lid. The top tray is full of baby memorabilia. Tiny 
[LINE_0071] shoes, ceramic hand molds, crayon drawings populated by stick figures and smiling suns, report cards, 
[LINE_0072] dance recital pictures. 
[LINE_0073] 
[LINE_0074] I lift the tray from the trunk and set it aside. 
[LINE_0075] 
[LINE_0076] The mementos in the bottom of the trunk are in a messy pile: several faded leather-bound journals; a 
[LINE_0077] packet of aged postcards tied together with a blue satin ribbon; a cardboard box bent in one corner; a set 
[LINE_0078] of slim books of poetry by Julien Rossignol; and a shoebox that holds hundreds of black-and-white 
[LINE_0079] photographs. 
[LINE_0080] 
[LINE_0081] On top is a yellowed, faded piece of paper. 
[LINE_0082] 
[LINE_0083] My hands are shaking as I pick it up. It is a carte d’identite, an identity card, from the war. I see the 
[LINE_0084] small, passport-sized photo of a young woman. Juliette Gervaise. 
[LINE_0085] 
[LINE_0086] “Mom?” 
[LINE_0087] 
[LINE_0088] I hear my son on the creaking wooden steps, footsteps that match my heartbeats. Has he called out 
[LINE_0089] to me before? 
[LINE_0090] 
[LINE_0091] “Mom? You shouldn’t be up here. Shit. The steps are unsteady.” He comes to stand beside me. “One 
[LINE_0092] fall and — ” 
[LINE_0093] 
[LINE_0094] I touch his pant leg, shake my head softly. I can’t look up. “Don’t” is all I can say. 
[LINE_0095] 
[LINE_0096] He kneels, then sits. I can smell his aftershave, something subtle and spicy, and also a hint of smoke. 
[LINE_0097] He has sneaked a cigarette outside, a habit he gave up decades ago and took up again at my recent 
[LINE_0098] diagnosis. There is no reason to voice my disapproval: He is a doctor. He knows better. 
[LINE_0099] 
[LINE_0100] My instinct is to toss the card into the trunk and slam the lid down, hiding it again. It’s what I have 
[LINE_0101] done all my life. 
[LINE_0102] 
[LINE_0103] Now I am dying. Not quickly, perhaps, but not slowly, either, and I feel compelled to look back on 
[LINE_0104] my life. 
[LINE_0105] 
[LINE_0106] “Mom, you’re crying.” 
[LINE_0107] 
[LINE_0108] 
[LINE_0109] 
[LINE_0110] “Am I?” 
[LINE_0111] 
[LINE_0112] I want to tell him the truth, but I can’t. It embarrasses and shames me, this failure. At my age, I 
[LINE_0113] should not be afraid of anything — certainly not my own past. 
[LINE_0114] 
[LINE_0115] I say only, “I want to take this trunk.” 
[LINE_0116] 
[LINE_0117] “It’s too big. I’ll repack the things you want into a smaller box.” 
[LINE_0118] 
[LINE_0119] I smile at his attempt to control me. “I love you and I am sick again. For these reasons, I have let 
[LINE_0120] you push me around, but I am not dead yet. I want this trunk with me.” 
[LINE_0121] 
[LINE_0122] “What can you possibly need in it? It’s just our artwork and other junk.” 
[LINE_0123] 
[LINE_0124] If I had told him the truth long ago, or had danced and drunk and sung more, maybe he would have 
[LINE_0125] seen me instead of a dependable, ordinary mother. He loves a version of me that is incomplete. I always 
[LINE_0126] thought it was what I wanted: to be loved and admired. Now I think perhaps I’d like to be known. 
[LINE_0127] 
[LINE_0128] “Think of this as my last request.” 
[LINE_0129] 
[LINE_0130] I can see that he wants to tell me not to talk that way, but he’s afraid his voice will catch. He clears 
[LINE_0131] his throat. “You’ve beaten it twice before. You’ll beat it again.” 
[LINE_0132] 
[LINE_0133] We both know this isn’t true. I am unsteady and weak. I can neither sleep nor eat without the help of 
[LINE_0134] medical science. “Of course I will.” 
[LINE_0135] 
[LINE_0136] “I just want to keep you safe.” 
[LINE_0137] 
[LINE_0138] I smile. Americans can be so naive. 
[LINE_0139] 
[LINE_0140] Once I shared his optimism. I thought the world was safe. But that was a long time ago. 
[LINE_0141] 
[LINE_0142] “Who is Juliette Gervaise?” Julien says and it shocks me a little to hear that name from him. 
[LINE_0143] 
[LINE_0144] I close my eyes and in the darkness that smells of mildew and bygone lives, my mind casts back, a 
[LINE_0145] line thrown across years and continents. Against my will — or maybe in tand^ with it, who knows 
[LINE_0146] anymore? — I remember.
