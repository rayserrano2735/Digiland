[LINE_0376] sheet of paper in front of him. “Madame. Most excellent. I am pleased you are returned.” 
[LINE_0377] 
[LINE_0378] She moved forward cautiously, holding the packet of postcards tightly. They’d been tied up with a 
[LINE_0379] scrap of twine. “I ... have some postcards here ... written by friends in town ... to our husbands ... but 
[LINE_0380] we don’t know where to send them. I hoped . . . perhaps you could help us.” 
[LINE_0381] 
[LINE_0382] She shifted uncomfortably from one foot to the other, feeling acutely vulnerable. 
[LINE_0383] 
[LINE_0384] “Of course, Madame. I would be pleased to do this favor for you. Although it will take much time 
[LINE_0385] and research to accomplish.” He rose politely. “As it happens, I am now concocting a list for my 
[LINE_0386] superiors at the Kommandantur. They need to know the names of some of the teachers at your school.” 
[LINE_0387] “Oh,” she said, uncertain as to why he would tell her this. He never spoke of his work. Of course, 
[LINE_0388] they didn’t speak often about anything. 
[LINE_0389] 
[LINE_0390] “Jews. Communists. Homosexuals. Freemasons. Jehovah’s Witnesses. Do you know these people?” 
[LINE_0391] “I am Catholic, Herr Captain, as you know. We do not speak of such things at school. I hardly know 
[LINE_0392] who are homosexuals and Freemasons, at any rate.” 
[LINE_0393] 
[LINE_0394] “Ah. So you know the others.” 
[LINE_0395] 
[LINE_0396] “I don’t understand. . .” 
[LINE_0397] 
[LINE_0398] “I am unclear. My pardons. I would appreciate it most sternly if you would let me know the names 
[LINE_0399] 
[LINE_0400] 
[LINE_0401] 
[LINE_0402] 
[LINE_0403] of the teachers in your school who are Jewish or communist.” 
[LINE_0404] 
[LINE_0405] “Why do you need their names?” 
[LINE_0406] 
[LINE_0407] “It is clerical, merely. You know us Germans: we are list makers.” He smiled and pulled out a chair 
[LINE_0408] for her. 
[LINE_0409] 
[LINE_0410] Vianne stared down at the blank paper on the table; then at the postcards in her hand. If Antoine 
[LINE_0411] received one, he might write back. She might know at last if he was alive. “This is not secret 
[LINE_0412] information, Herr Captain. Anyone can give you these names.” 
[LINE_0413] 
[LINE_0414] He moved in close to her. “With some effort, Madame, I believe I can find your husband’s address 
[LINE_0415] and mail a package for you, also. Would this be sanguine?” 
[LINE_0416] 
[LINE_0417] “‘Sanguine’ is not the right word, Herr Captain. You mean to ask me if it would be all right.” She 
[LINE_0418] was stalling and she knew it. Worse, she was pretty sure that he knew it. 
[LINE_0419] 
[LINE_0420] “Ah. Thank you so much for tutoring me in your beautiful language. My apologies.” He offered her 
[LINE_0421] a pen. “Do not worry, Madame. It is clerical, merely.” 
[LINE_0422] 
[LINE_0423] Vianne wanted to say that she wouldn’t write down any names, but what would be the point? It was 
[LINE_0424] easy enough for him to get this information in town. Everyone knew whose names belonged on the list. 
[LINE_0425] And Beck could throw her out of her own house for such a defiance — and what would she do then? 
[LINE_0426] 
[LINE_0427] She sat down and picked up the pen and began to write down names. It wasn’t until the end of the 
[LINE_0428] list that she paused and lifted the pen tip from the paper. “I’m done,” she said in a soft voice. 
[LINE_0429] 
[LINE_0430] “You have forgotten your friend.” 
[LINE_0431] 
[LINE_0432] “Did I?” 
[LINE_0433] 
[LINE_0434] “Surely you meant to be accurate.” 
[LINE_0435] 
[LINE_0436] She bit her lip nervously and looked down at the list of names. She was certain suddenly that she 
[LINE_0437] shouldn’t have done this. But what choice did she have? He was in control of her home. What would 
[LINE_0438] happen if she defied him? Slowly, feeling sick to her stomach, she wrote the last name on the list. 
[LINE_0439] 
[LINE_0440] Rachel de Champlain.
