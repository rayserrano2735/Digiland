[LINE_0004] 
[LINE_0005] Vianne knew something of war. Not its clash and clatter and smoke and blood, perhaps, but the 
[LINE_0006] aftermath. Though she had been born in peacetime, her earliest memories were of the war. She 
[LINE_0007] remembered watching her maman cry as she said good-bye to Papa. She remembered being hungry and 
[LINE_0008] always being cold. But most of all, she remembered how different her father was when he came home, 
[LINE_0009] how he limped and sighed and was silent. That was when he began drinking and keeping to himself and 
[LINE_0010] ignoring his family. After that, she remembered doors slamming shut, arguments erupting and 
[LINE_0011] disappearing into clumsy silences, and her parents sleeping in different rooms. 
[LINE_0012] 
[LINE_0013] The father who went off to war was not the one who came home. She had tried to be loved by him; 
[LINE_0014] more important, she had tried to keep loving him, but in the end, one was as impossible as the other. In 
[LINE_0015] the years since he’d shipped her off to Carriveau, Vianne had made her own life. She sent her father 
[LINE_0016] Christmas and birthday cards, but she’d never received one in return, and they rarely spoke. What was 
[LINE_0017] there left to say? Unlike Isabelle, who seemed incapable of letting go, Vianne understood — and 
[LINE_0018] accepted — that when Maman had died, their family had been irreparably broken. He was a man who 
[LINE_0019] simply refused to be a father to his children. 
[LINE_0020] 
[LINE_0021] “I know how war scares you,” Antoine said. 
[LINE_0022] 
[LINE_0023] “The Maginot Line will hold,” she said, trying to sound convincing. “You’ll be home by Christmas.” 
[LINE_0024] The Maginot Line was miles and miles of concrete walls and obstacles and weapons that had been 
[LINE_0025] constructed along the German border after the Great War to protect France. The Germans couldn’t 
[LINE_0026] breach it. 
[LINE_0027] 
[LINE_0028] Antoine took her in his arms. The scent of jasmine was intoxicating, and she knew suddenly, 
[LINE_0029] certainly, that from now on, whenever she smelled jasmine, she would remember this good-bye. 
[LINE_0030] 
[LINE_0031] “I love you, Antoine Mauriac, and I expect you to come home to me.” 
[LINE_0032] 
[LINE_0033] Later, she couldn’t remember them moving into the house, climbing the stairs, lying down in bed, 
[LINE_0034] undressing each other. She remembered only being naked in his arms, lying beneath him as he made 
[LINE_0035] love to her in a way he never had before, with frantic, searching kisses and hands that seemed to want to 
[LINE_0036] tear her apart even as they held her together. 
[LINE_0037] 
[LINE_0038] “You’re stronger than you think you are, V,” he said afterward, when they lay quietly in each other’s 
[LINE_0039] 
[LINE_0040] 
[LINE_0041] 
[LINE_0042] arms. 
[LINE_0043] 
[LINE_0044] 
[LINE_0045] 
[LINE_0046] “I’m not,” she whispered too quietly for him to hear. 
[LINE_0047] 
[LINE_0048] 
[LINE_0049] 
[LINE_0050] * * * 
[LINE_0051] 
[LINE_0052] The next morning, Vianne wanted to keep Antoine in bed all day, maybe even convince him that they 
[LINE_0053] should pack their bags and run like thieves in the night. 
[LINE_0054] 
[LINE_0055] But where would they go? War hung over all of Europe. 
[LINE_0056] 
[LINE_0057] By the time she finished making breakfast and doing the dishes, a headache throbbed at the base of 
[LINE_0058] her skull. 
[LINE_0059] 
[LINE_0060] “You seem sad, Maman,” Sophie said. 
[LINE_0061] 
[LINE_0062] “How can I be sad on a gorgeous summer’s day when we are going to visit our best friends?” 
[LINE_0063] Vianne smiled a bit too brightly. 
[LINE_0064] 
[LINE_0065] It wasn’t until she was out the front door and standing beneath one of the apple trees in the front 
[LINE_0066] yard that she realized she was barefoot. 
[LINE_0067] 
[LINE_0068] “Maman,” Sophie said impatiently. 
[LINE_0069] 
[LINE_0070] “I’m coming,” she said, as she followed Sophie through the front yard, past the old dovecote (now a 
[LINE_0071] gardening shed) and the empty barn. Sophie opened the back gate and ran into the well-tended 
[LINE_0072] neighboring yard, toward a small stone cottage with blue shutters. 
[LINE_0073] 
[LINE_0074] Sophie knocked once, got no answer, and went inside. 
[LINE_0075] 
[LINE_0076] “Sophie!” Vianne said sharply, but her admonishment fell on deaf ears. Manners were unnecessary 
[LINE_0077] at one’s best friend’s house, and Rachel de Champlain had been Vianne ’s best friend for fifteen years. 
[LINE_0078] They’d met only a month after Papa had so ignominiously dropped his children off at Le Jardin. 
[LINE_0079] 
[LINE_0080] They’d been a pair back then: Vianne, slight and pale and nervous, and Rachel, as tall as the boys, 
[LINE_0081] with eyebrows that grew faster than a lie and a voice like a foghorn. Outsiders, both of them, until they 
[LINE_0082] met. They’d become inseparable in school and stayed friends in all the years since. They’d gone to 
[LINE_0083] university together and both had become schoolteachers. They’d even been pregnant at the same time. 
[LINE_0084] Now they taught in side-by-side classrooms at the local school. 
[LINE_0085] 
[LINE_0086] Rachel appeared in the open doorway, holding her newborn son, Ariel. 
[LINE_0087] 
[LINE_0088] A look passed between the women. In it was everything they felt and feared. 
[LINE_0089] 
[LINE_0090] Vianne followed her friend into a small, brightly lit interior that was as neat as a pin. A vase full of 
[LINE_0091] wildflowers graced the rough wooden trestle table flanked by mismatched chairs. In the corner of the 
[LINE_0092] dining room was a leather valise, and sitting on top of it was the brown felt fedora that Rachel’s 
[LINE_0093] husband, Marc, favored. Rachel went into the kitchen for a small crockery plate full of caneles. Then 
[LINE_0094] the women headed outside. 
[LINE_0095] 
[LINE_0096] In the small backyard, roses grew along a privet hedge. A table and four chairs sat unevenly on a 
[LINE_0097] stone patio. Antique lanterns hung from the branches of a chestnut tree. 
[LINE_0098] 
[LINE_0099] Vianne picked up a canele and took a bite, savoring the vanilla-rich cream center and crispy, slightly 
[LINE_0100] burned-tasting exterior. She sat down. 
[LINE_0101] 
[LINE_0102] Rachel sat down across from her, with the baby asleep in her arms. Silence seemed to expand 
[LINE_0103] 
[LINE_0104] 
[LINE_0105] 
[LINE_0106] between them and fill with their fears and misgivings. 
[LINE_0107] 
[LINE_0108] “I wonder if he’ll know his father,” Rachel said as she looked down at her baby. 
[LINE_0109] 
[LINE_0110] “They’ll be changed,” Vianne said, remembering. Her father had been in the Battle of the Somme, in 
[LINE_0111] which more than three-quarters of a million men had lost their lives. Rumors of German atrocities had 
[LINE_0112] come home with the few who survived. 
[LINE_0113] 
[LINE_0114] Rachel moved the infant to her shoulder, patted his back soothingly. “Marc is no good at changing 
[LINE_0115] diapers. And Ari loves to sleep in our bed. I guess that’ll be all right now.” 
[LINE_0116] 
[LINE_0117] Vianne felt a smile start. It was a little thing, this joke, but it helped. “Antoine’s snoring is a pain in 
[LINE_0118] the backside. I should get some good sleep.” 
[LINE_0119] 
[LINE_0120] “And we can have poached eggs for supper.” 
[LINE_0121] 
[LINE_0122] “Only half the laundry,” she said, but then her voice broke. “I’m not strong enough for this, Rachel.” 
[LINE_0123] “Of course you are. We’ll get through it together.” 
[LINE_0124] 
[LINE_0125] “Before I met Antoine...” 
[LINE_0126] 
[LINE_0127] Rachel waved a hand dismissively. “I know. I know. You were as skinny as a branch, you stuttered 
[LINE_0128] when you got nervous, and you were allergic to everything. I know. I was there. But that’s all over now. 
[LINE_0129] You’ll be strong. You know why?” 
[LINE_0130] 
[LINE_0131] “Why?” 
[LINE_0132] 
[LINE_0133] Rachel’s smile faded. “I know I’m big — statuesque, as they like to say when they’re selling me 
[LINE_0134] brassieres and stockings — but I feel . . . undone by this, V. I am going to need to lean on you sometimes, 
[LINE_0135] too. Not with all my weight, of course.” 
[LINE_0136] 
[LINE_0137] “So we can’t both fall apart at the same time.” 
[LINE_0138] 
[LINE_0139] “Vbi/a,” Rachel said. “Our plan. Should we open a bottle of cognac now, or gin?” 
[LINE_0140] 
[LINE_0141] “It’s ten o’clock in the morning.” 
[LINE_0142] 
[LINE_0143] “You’re right. Of course. A French 75.” 
[LINE_0144] 
[LINE_0145] 
[LINE_0146] 
[LINE_0147] * * * 
[LINE_0148] 
[LINE_0149] On Tuesday morning when Vianne awoke, sunlight poured through the window, glazing the exposed 
[LINE_0150] timbers. 
[LINE_0151] 
[LINE_0152] Antoine sat in the chair by the window, a walnut rocker he’d made during Vianne’s second 
[LINE_0153] pregnancy. For years that empty rocker had mocked them. The miscarriage years, as she thought of 
[LINE_0154] them now. Desolation in a land of plenty. Three lost lives in four years; tiny thready heartbeats, blue 
[LINE_0155] hands. And then, miraculously: a baby who survived. Sophie. There were sad little ghosts caught in the 
[LINE_0156] wood grain of that chair, but there were good memories, too. 
[LINE_0157] 
[LINE_0158] “Maybe you should take Sophie to Paris,” he said as she sat up. “Julien would look out for you.” 
[LINE_0159] 
[LINE_0160] “My father has made his opinion on living with his daughters quite clear. I cannot expect a welcome 
[LINE_0161] from him.” Vianne pushed the matelasse coverlet aside and rose, putting her bare feet on the worn rug. 
[LINE_0162] 
[LINE_0163] “Will you be all right?” 
[LINE_0164] 
[LINE_0165] “Sophie and I will be fine. You’ll be home in no time anyway. The Maginot Line will hold. And 
[LINE_0166] 
[LINE_0167] 
[LINE_0168] 
[LINE_0169] 
[LINE_0170] Lord knows the Germans are no match for us.” 
[LINE_0171] 
[LINE_0172] “Too bad their weapons are. I took all of our money out of the bank. There are sixty-five thousand 
[LINE_0173] francs in the mattress. Use it wisely, Vianne. Along with your teaching salary, it should last you a good 
[LINE_0174] long time.” 
[LINE_0175] 
[LINE_0176] She felt a flutter of panic. She knew too little about their finances. Antoine handled them. 
[LINE_0177] 
[LINE_0178] He stood up slowly and took her in his arms. She wanted to bottle how safe she felt in this moment, 
[LINE_0179] so she could drink of it later when loneliness and fear left her parched. 
[LINE_0180] 
[LINE_0181] Remember this, she thought. The way the light caught in his unruly hair, the love in his brown eyes, 
[LINE_0182] the chapped lips that had kissed her only an hour ago, in the darkness. 
[LINE_0183] 
[LINE_0184] Through the open window behind them, she heard the slow, even clop-clop-clop of a horse moving 
[LINE_0185] up the road and the clattering of the wagon being pulled along behind. 
[LINE_0186] 
[LINE_0187] That would be Monsieur Quillian on his way to market with his flowers. If she were in the yard, he 
[LINE_0188] would stop and give her one and say it couldn’t match her beauty, and she would smile and say merci 
[LINE_0189] and offer him something to drink. 
[LINE_0190] 
[LINE_0191] Vianne pulled away reluctantly. She went over to the wooden dresser and poured tepid water from 
[LINE_0192] the blue crockery pitcher into the bowl and washed her face. In the alcove that served as their wardrobe, 
[LINE_0193] behind a pair of gold and white toile curtains, she put on her brassiere and stepped into her lace-trimmed 
[LINE_0194] drawers and garter. She smoothed the silk stockings up her legs, fastened them to her garters, and then 
[LINE_0195] slipped into a belted cotton frock with a squared yoke collar. When she closed the curtains and turned 
[LINE_0196] around, Antoine was gone. 
[LINE_0197] 
[LINE_0198] She retrieved her handbag and went down the hallway to Sophie’s room. Like theirs, it was small, 
[LINE_0199] with a steeply pitched, timbered ceiling, wide plank wooden floors, and a window that overlooked the 
[LINE_0200] orchard. An ironwork bed, a nightstand with a hand-me-down lamp, and a blue-painted armoire filled 
[LINE_0201] the space. Sophie’s drawings decorated the walls. 
[LINE_0202] 
[LINE_0203] Vianne opened the shutters and let light flood the room. 
[LINE_0204] 
[LINE_0205] As usual in the hot summer months, Sophie had kicked the coverlet to the floor sometime in the 
[LINE_0206] night. Her pink stuffed teddy bear, Bebe, slept against her cheek. 
[LINE_0207] 
[LINE_0208] Vianne picked up the bear, staring down at its matted, much petted face. Last year, Bebe had been 
[LINE_0209] forgotten on a shelf by the window as Sophie moved on to newer toys. 
[LINE_0210] 
[LINE_0211] Now Bebe was back. 
[LINE_0212] 
[LINE_0213] Vianne leaned down to kiss her daughter’s cheek. 
[LINE_0214] 
[LINE_0215] Sophie rolled over and blinked awake. 
[LINE_0216] 
[LINE_0217] “I don’t want Papa to go, Maman,” she whispered. She reached out for Bebe, practically snatched 
[LINE_0218] the bear from Vianne ’s hands. 
[LINE_0219] 
[LINE_0220] “I know.” Vianne sighed. “I know.” 
[LINE_0221] 
[LINE_0222] Vianne went to the armoire, where she picked out the sailor dress that was Sophie’s favorite. 
[LINE_0223] 
[LINE_0224] “Can I wear the daisy crown Papa made me?” 
[LINE_0225] 
[LINE_0226] The daisy “crown” lay crumpled on the nightstand, the little flowers wilted. Vianne picked it up 
[LINE_0227] 
[LINE_0228] 
[LINE_0229] 
[LINE_0230] 
[LINE_0231] gently and placed it on Sophie’s head. 
[LINE_0232] 
[LINE_0233] Vianne thought she was doing all right until she stepped into the living room and saw Antoine. 
[LINE_0234] 
[LINE_0235] “Papa?” Sophie touched the wilted daisy crown uncertainly. “Don’t go.” 
[LINE_0236] 
[LINE_0237] Antoine knelt down and drew Sophie into his embrace. “I have to be a soldier to keep you and 
[LINE_0238] Maman safe. But I’ll be back before you know it.” 
[LINE_0239] 
[LINE_0240] Vianne heard the crack in his voice. 
[LINE_0241] 
[LINE_0242] Sophie drew back. The daisy crown was sagging down the side of her head. “You promise you’ll 
[LINE_0243] come home?” 
[LINE_0244] 
[LINE_0245] Antoine looked past his daughter’s earnest face to Vianne ’s worried gaze. 
[LINE_0246] 
[LINE_0247] “Oui,” he said at last. 
[LINE_0248] 
[LINE_0249] Sophie nodded. 
[LINE_0250] 
[LINE_0251] The three of them were silent as they left the house. They walked hand in hand up the hillside to the 
[LINE_0252] gray wooden barn. Knee-high golden grass covered the knoll, and lilac bushes as big as hay wagons 
[LINE_0253] grew along the perimeter of the property. Three small white crosses were all that remained in this world 
[LINE_0254] to mark the babies Vianne had lost. Today, she didn’t let her gaze linger there at all. Her emotions were 
[LINE_0255] heavy enough right now; she couldn’t add the weight of those memories, too. 
[LINE_0256] 
[LINE_0257] Inside the barn sat their old, green Renault. When they were all in the automobile, Antoine started 
[LINE_0258] up the engine, backed out of the barn, and drove on browning ribbons of dead grass to the road. Vianne 
[LINE_0259] stared out the small, dusty window, watching the green valley pass in a blur of familiar images — red tile 
[LINE_0260] roofs, stone cottages, fields of hay and grapes, spindly-treed forests. 
[LINE_0261] 
[LINE_0262] All too quickly they arrived at the train station near Tours. 
[LINE_0263] 
[LINE_0264] The platform was filled with young men carrying suitcases and women kissing them good-bye and 
[LINE_0265] children crying. 
[LINE_0266] 
[LINE_0267] A generation of men were going off to war. Again. 
[LINE_0268] 
[LINE_0269] Don’t think about it, Vianne told herself. Don’t remember what it was like last time when the men 
[LINE_0270] limped home, faces burned, missing arms and legs ... 
[LINE_0271] 
[LINE_0272] Vianne clung to her husband’s hand as Antoine bought their tickets and led them onto the train. In 
[LINE_0273] the third-class carriage — stiflingly hot, people packed in like marsh reeds — she sat stiffly upright, still 
[LINE_0274] holding her husband’s hand, with her handbag on her lap. 
[LINE_0275] 
[LINE_0276] At their destination, a dozen or so men disembarked. Vianne and Sophie and Antoine followed the 
[LINE_0277] others down a cobblestoned street and into a charming village that looked like most small communes in 
[LINE_0278] Touraine. How was it possible that war was coming and that this quaint town with its tumbling flowers 
[LINE_0279] and crumbling walls was amassing soldiers to fight? 
[LINE_0280] 
[LINE_0281] Antoine tugged at her hand, got her moving again. When had she stopped? 
[LINE_0282] 
[LINE_0283] Up ahead a set of tall, recently erected iron gates had been bolted into stone walls. Behind them 
[LINE_0284] were rows of temporary housing. 
[LINE_0285] 
[LINE_0286] The gates swung open. A soldier on horseback rode out to greet the new arrivals, his leather saddle 
[LINE_0287] creaking at the horse’s steps, his face dusty and flushed from heat. He pulled on the reins and the horse 
[LINE_0288] 
[LINE_0289] 
[LINE_0290] 
[LINE_0291] 
[LINE_0292] halted, throwing its head and snorting. An aeroplane droned overhead. 
[LINE_0293] 
[LINE_0294] “You, men,” the soldier said. “Bring your papers to the lieutenant over there by the gate. Now. 
[LINE_0295] Move.” 
[LINE_0296] 
[LINE_0297] Antoine kissed Vianne with a gentleness that made her want to cry. 
[LINE_0298] 
[LINE_0299] “I love you,” he said against her lips. 
[LINE_0300] 
[LINE_0301] “I love you, too,” she said but the words that always seemed so big felt small now. What was love 
[LINE_0302] when put up against war? 
[LINE_0303] 
[LINE_0304] “Me, too, Papa. Me, too!” Sophie cried, flinging herself into his arms. They embraced as a family, 
[LINE_0305] one last time, until Antoine pulled back. 
[LINE_0306] 
[LINE_0307] “Good-bye,” he said. 
[LINE_0308] 
[LINE_0309] Vianne couldn’t say it in return. She watched him walk away, watched him merge into the crowd of 
[LINE_0310] laughing, talking young men, becoming indistinguishable. The big iron gates slammed shut, the clang of 
[LINE_0311] metal reverberating in the hot, dusty air, and Vianne and Sophie stood alone in the middle of the street.
