[LINE_0001] FOUR
[LINE_0002] 
[LINE_0003] June 1940 
[LINE_0004] France 
[LINE_0005] 
[LINE_0006] 
[LINE_0007] 
[LINE_0008] The medieval villa dominated a deeply green, forested hillside. It looked like something in a 
[LINE_0009] confectioner’s shopwindow; a castle sculpted of caramel, with spun-sugar windows and shutters the 
[LINE_0010] color of candied apples. Far below, a deep blue lake absorbed the reflection of the clouds. Manicured 
[LINE_0011] gardens allowed the villa’s occupants — and, more important, their guests — to stroll about the grounds, 
[LINE_0012] where only acceptable topics were to be discussed. 
[LINE_0013] 
[LINE_0014] In the formal dining room, Isabelle Rossignol sat stiffly erect at the white-clothed table that easily 
[LINE_0015] accommodated twenty-four diners. Everything in this room was pale. Walls and floor and ceiling were 
[LINE_0016] all crafted of oyster-hued stone. The ceiling arched into a peak nearly twenty feet overhead. Sound was 
[LINE_0017] amplified in this cold room, as trapped as the occupants. 
[LINE_0018] 
[LINE_0019] Madame Dufour stood at the head of the table, dressed in a severe black dress that revealed the soup 
[LINE_0020] spoon-sized hollow at the base of her long neck. A single diamond brooch was her only adornment (one 
[LINE_0021] good piece, ladies, and choose it well; everything makes a statement, nothing speaks quite so loudly as 
[LINE_0022] cheapness). Her narrow face ended in a blunt chin and was framed by curls so obviously peroxided the 
[LINE_0023] desired impression of youth was quite undone. “The trick,” she was saying in a cultivated voice, clipped 
[LINE_0024] and cut, “is to be completely quiet and unremarkable in your task.” 
[LINE_0025] 
[LINE_0026] Each of the girls at the table wore the fitted blue woolen jacket and skirt that was the school 
[LINE_0027] uniform. It wasn’t so bad in the winter, but on this hot June afternoon, the ensemble was unbearable. 
[LINE_0028] Isabelle could feel herself beginning to sweat, and no amount of lavender in her soap could mask the 
[LINE_0029] sharp scent of her perspiration. 
[LINE_0030] 
[LINE_0031] She stared down at the unpeeled orange placed in the center of her Limoges china plate. Flatware 
[LINE_0032] lay in precise formation on either side of the plate. Salad fork, dinner fork, knife, spoon, butter knife, 
[LINE_0033] fish fork. It went on and on. 
[LINE_0034] 
[LINE_0035] “Now,” Madame Dufour said. “Pick up the correct utensils — quietly, s’// vous plait, quietly, and peel 
[LINE_0036] your orange.” 
[LINE_0037] 
[LINE_0038] Isabelle picked up her fork and tried to ease the sharp prongs into the heavy peel, but the orange 
[LINE_0039] rolled away from her and bumped over the gilt edge of the plate, clattering the china. 
[LINE_0040] 
[LINE_0041] “Merde, ” she muttered, grabbing the orange before it fell to the floor. 
[LINE_0042] 
[LINE_0043] “Merde ? ” Madame Dufour was beside her. 
[LINE_0044] 
[LINE_0045] Isabelle jumped in her seat. Mon Dieu, the woman moved like a viper in the reeds. “Pardon, 
[LINE_0046] 
[LINE_0047] 
[LINE_0048] 
[LINE_0049] Madame,” Isabelle said, returning the orange to its place. 
[LINE_0050] 
[LINE_0051] “Mademoiselle Rossignol,” Madame said. “How is it that you have graced our halls for two years 
[LINE_0052] and learned so little?” 
[LINE_0053] 
[LINE_0054] Isabelle again stabbed the orange with her fork. A graceless — but effective — move. Then she smiled 
[LINE_0055] up at Madame. “Generally, Madame, the failing of a student to learn is the failing of the teacher to 
[LINE_0056] teach.” 
[LINE_0057] 
[LINE_0058] Breaths were indrawn all down the table. 
[LINE_0059] 
[LINE_0060] “Ah,” Madame said. “So we are the reason you still cannot manage to eat an orange properly.” 
[LINE_0061] 
[LINE_0062] Isabelle tried to slice through the peel — too hard, too fast. The silver blade slipped off the puckered 
[LINE_0063] peel and clanged on the china plate. 
[LINE_0064] 
[LINE_0065] Madame Dufour’s hand snaked out; her fingers coiled around Isabelle’s wrist. 
[LINE_0066] 
[LINE_0067] All up and down the table, the girls watched. 
[LINE_0068] 
[LINE_0069] “Polite conversation, girls,” Madame said, smiling thinly. “No one wants a statue for a dinner 
[LINE_0070] partner.” 
[LINE_0071] 
[LINE_0072] On cue, the girls began speaking quietly to one another about things that did not interest Isabelle. 
[LINE_0073] Gardening, weather, fashion. Acceptable topics for women. Isabelle heard the girl next to her say 
[LINE_0074] quietly, “I am so very fond of Alen^on lace, aren’t you?” and really, it was all she could do to keep from 
[LINE_0075] screaming. 
[LINE_0076] 
[LINE_0077] “Mademoiselle Rossignol,” Madame said. “You will go see Madame Allard and tell her that our 
[LINE_0078] experiment has come to an end.” 
[LINE_0079] 
[LINE_0080] “What does that mean?” 
[LINE_0081] 
[LINE_0082] “She will know. Go.” 
[LINE_0083] 
[LINE_0084] Isabelle scooted back from the table quickly, lest Madame change her mind. 
[LINE_0085] 
[LINE_0086] Madame ’s face scrunched in displeasure at the loud screech the chair legs made on the stone floor. 
[LINE_0087] 
[LINE_0088] Isabelle smiled. “I really do not like oranges, you know.” 
[LINE_0089] 
[LINE_0090] “Really?” Madame said sarcastically. 
[LINE_0091] 
[LINE_0092] Isabelle wanted to run from this stifling room, but she was already in enough trouble, so she forced 
[LINE_0093] herself to walk slowly, her shoulders back, her chin up. At the stairs (which she could navigate with 
[LINE_0094] three books on her head if required), she glanced sideways, saw that she was alone, and rushed down. 
[LINE_0095] 
[LINE_0096] In the hallway below, she slowed and straightened. By the time she reached the headmistress’s 
[LINE_0097] office, she wasn’t even breathing hard. 
[LINE_0098] 
[LINE_0099] She knocked. 
[LINE_0100] 
[LINE_0101] At Madame’s flat “Come in,” Isabelle opened the door. 
[LINE_0102] 
[LINE_0103] Madame Allard sat behind a gilt-trimmed mahogany writing desk. Medieval tapestries hung from 
[LINE_0104] the stone walls of the room and an arched, leaded-glass window overlooked gardens so sculpted they 
[LINE_0105] were more art than nature. Even birds rarely landed here; no doubt they sensed the stifling atmosphere 
[LINE_0106] and flew on. 
[LINE_0107] 
[LINE_0108] Isabelle sat down — remembering an instant too late that she hadn’t been offered a seat. She popped 
[LINE_0109] 
[LINE_0110] 
[LINE_0111] 
[LINE_0112] 
[LINE_0113] back up. “Pardon, Madame.” 
[LINE_0114] 
[LINE_0115] “Sit down, Isabelle.” 
[LINE_0116] 
[LINE_0117] She did, carefully crossing her ankles as a lady should, clasping her hands together. “Madame 
[LINE_0118] Dufour asked me to tell you that the experiment is over.” 
[LINE_0119] 
[LINE_0120] Madame reached for one of the Murano fountain pens on her desk and picked it up, tapping it on the 
[LINE_0121] desk. “Why are you here, Isabelle?” 
[LINE_0122] 
[LINE_0123] “I hate oranges.” 
[LINE_0124] 
[LINE_0125] “Pardon?” 
[LINE_0126] 
[LINE_0127] “And if I were to eat an orange — which, honestly, Madame, why would I when I don’t like them — I 
[LINE_0128] would use my hands like the Americans do. Like everyone does, really. A fork and knife to eat an 
[LINE_0129] orange?” 
[LINE_0130] 
[LINE_0131] “I mean, why are you at the school?” 
[LINE_0132] 
[LINE_0133] “Oh. That. Well, the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Avignon expelled me. For nothing, I might 
[LINE_0134] add.” 
[LINE_0135] 
[LINE_0136] “And the Sisters of St. Francis?” 
[LINE_0137] 
[LINE_0138] “Ah. They had reason to expel me.” 
[LINE_0139] 
[LINE_0140] “And the school before that?” 
[LINE_0141] 
[LINE_0142] Isabelle didn’t know what to say. 
[LINE_0143] 
[LINE_0144] Madame put down her fountain pen. “You are almost nineteen.” 
[LINE_0145] 
[LINE_0146] “Old, Madame.” 
[LINE_0147] 
[LINE_0148] “I think it’s time for you to leave.” 
[LINE_0149] 
[LINE_0150] Isabelle got to her feet. “Shall I return to the orange lesson?” 
[LINE_0151] 
[LINE_0152] “You misunderstand. I mean you should leave the school, Isabelle. It is clear that you are not 
[LINE_0153] interested in learning what we have to teach you.” 
[LINE_0154] 
[LINE_0155] “How to eat an orange and when you can spread cheese and who is more important — the second son 
[LINE_0156] of a duke or a daughter who won’t inherit or an ambassador to an unimportant country? Madame, do 
[LINE_0157] you not know what is going on in the world?” 
[LINE_0158] 
[LINE_0159] Isabelle might have been secreted deep in the countryside, but still she knew. Even here, barricaded 
[LINE_0160] behind hedges and bludgeoned by politeness, she knew what was happening in France. At night in her 
[LINE_0161] monastic cell, while her classmates were in bed, she sat up, long into the night, listening to the BBC on 
[LINE_0162] her contraband radio. France had joined Britain in declaring war on Germany, and Hitler was on the 
[LINE_0163] move. All across France people had stockpiled food and put up blackout shades and learned to live like 
[LINE_0164] moles in the dark. 
[LINE_0165] 
[LINE_0166] They had prepared and worried and then . . . nothing. 
[LINE_0167] 
[LINE_0168] Month after month, nothing happened. 
[LINE_0169] 
[LINE_0170] At first all anyone could talk about was the Great War and the losses that had touched so many 
[LINE_0171] families, but as the months went on, and there was only talk of war, Isabelle heard her teachers calling it 
[LINE_0172] the drole de guerre, the phony war. The real horror was happening elsewhere in Europe; in Belgium and 
[LINE_0173] 
[LINE_0174] 
[LINE_0175] 
[LINE_0176] 
[LINE_0177] Holland and Poland. 
[LINE_0178] 
[LINE_0179] “Will manners not matter in war, Isabelle?” 
[LINE_0180] 
[LINE_0181] “They don’t matter now,” Isabelle said impulsively, wishing a moment later that she’d said nothing. 
[LINE_0182] 
[LINE_0183] Madame stood. “We were never the right place for you, but. . .” 
[LINE_0184] 
[LINE_0185] “My father would put me anywhere to be rid of me,” she said. Isabelle would rather blurt out the 
[LINE_0186] truth than hear another lie. She had learned many lessons in the parade of schools and convents that had 
[LINE_0187] housed her for more than a decade — most of all, she’d learned that she had to rely on herself. Certainly 
[LINE_0188] her father and her sister couldn’t be counted on. 
[LINE_0189] 
[LINE_0190] Madame looked at Isabelle. Her nose flared ever so slightly, an indication of polite but pained 
[LINE_0191] disapproval. “It is hard for a man to lose his wife.” 
[LINE_0192] 
[LINE_0193] “It is hard for a girl to lose her mother.” She smiled defiantly. “I lost both parents though, didn’t I? 
[LINE_0194] One died, and the other turned his back on me. I can’t say which hurt more.” 
[LINE_0195] 
[LINE_0196] “Mon Dieu, Isabelle, must you always speak whatever is on your mind?” 
[LINE_0197] 
[LINE_0198] Isabelle had heard this criticism all her life, but why should she hold her tongue? No one listened to 
[LINE_0199] her either way. 
[LINE_0200] 
[LINE_0201] “So you will leave today. I will telegram your father. Tomas will take you to the train.” 
[LINE_0202] 
[LINE_0203] “Tonight?” Isabelle blinked. “But ... Papa won’t want me.” 
[LINE_0204] 
[LINE_0205] “Ah. Consequences,” Madame said. “Perhaps now you will see that they should be considered.” 
[LINE_0206] 
[LINE_0207] * * * 
[LINE_0208] 
[LINE_0209] Isabelle was alone on a train again, heading toward an unknown reception. 
[LINE_0210] 
[LINE_0211] She stared out the dirty, mottled window at the flashing green landscape: fields of hay, red roofs, 
[LINE_0212] stone cottages, gray bridges, horses. 
[LINE_0213] 
[LINE_0214] Everything looked exactly as it always had and that surprised her. War was coming, and she’d 
[LINE_0215] imagined it would leave a mark on the countryside somehow, changing the grass color or killing the 
[LINE_0216] trees or scaring away the birds, but now, as she sat on this train chugging into Paris, she saw that 
[LINE_0217] everything looked completely ordinary. 
[LINE_0218] 
[LINE_0219] At the sprawling Gare de Lyon, the train came to a wheezing, belching stop. Isabelle reached down 
[LINE_0220] for the small valise at her feet and pulled it onto her lap. As she watched the passengers shuffle past her, 
[LINE_0221] exiting the train carriage, the question she’d avoided came back to her. 
[LINE_0222] 
[LINE_0223] Papa. 
[LINE_0224] 
[LINE_0225] She wanted to believe he would welcome her home, that finally, he would hold out his hands and 
[LINE_0226] say her name in a loving way, the way he had Before, when Maman had been the glue that held them 
[LINE_0227] together. 
[LINE_0228] 
[LINE_0229] She stared down at her scuffed suitcase. 
[LINE_0230] 
[LINE_0231] So small. 
[LINE_0232] 
[LINE_0233] Most of the girls in the schools she’d attended had arrived with a collection of trunks bound in 
[LINE_0234] leather straps and studded with brass tacks. They had pictures on their desks and mementos on their 
[LINE_0235] 
[LINE_0236] 
[LINE_0237] 
[LINE_0238] 
[LINE_0239] nightstands and photograph albums in their drawers. 
[LINE_0240] 
[LINE_0241] Isabelle had a single framed photograph of a woman she wanted to remember and couldn’t. When 
[LINE_0242] she tried, all that came to her were blurry images of people crying and the physician shaking his head 
[LINE_0243] and her mother saying something about holding tightly to her sister’s hand. 
[LINE_0244] 
[LINE_0245] As if that would help. Vianne had been as quick to abandon Isabelle as Papa had been. 
[LINE_0246] 
[LINE_0247] She realized that she was the only one left in the carriage. Clasping her suitcase in her gloved hand, 
[LINE_0248] she sidled out of the seat and exited the carriage. 
[LINE_0249] 
[LINE_0250] The platforms were full of people. Trains stood in shuddering rows; smoke filled the air, puffed up 
[LINE_0251] toward the high, arched ceiling. Somewhere a whistle blared. Great iron wheels began to churn. The 
[LINE_0252] platform trembled beneath her feet. 
[LINE_0253] 
[LINE_0254] Her father stood out, even in the crowd. 
[LINE_0255] 
[LINE_0256] When he spotted her, she saw the irritation that transformed his features, reshaped his expression 
[LINE_0257] into one of grim determination. 
[LINE_0258] 
[LINE_0259] He was a tall man, at least six foot two, but he had been bent by the Great War. Or at least that was 
[LINE_0260] what Isabelle remembered hearing once. His broad shoulders sloped downward, as if posture were too 
[LINE_0261] much to think about with all that was on his mind. His thinning hair was gray and unkempt. He had a 
[LINE_0262] broad, flattened nose, like a spatula, and lips as thin as an afterthought. On this hot summer day, he wore 
[LINE_0263] a wrinkled white shirt, with sleeves rolled up; a tie hung loosely tied around his fraying collar, and his 
[LINE_0264] corduroy pants were in need of laundering. 
[LINE_0265] 
[LINE_0266] She tried to look ... mature. Perhaps that was what he wanted of her. 
[LINE_0267] 
[LINE_0268] “Isabelle.” 
[LINE_0269] 
[LINE_0270] She clutched her suitcase handle in both hands. “Papa.” 
[LINE_0271] 
[LINE_0272] “Kicked out of another one.” 
[LINE_0273] 
[LINE_0274] She nodded, swallowing hard. 
[LINE_0275] 
[LINE_0276] “How will we find another school in these times?” 
[LINE_0277] 
[LINE_0278] That was her opening. “I want to live with you, Papa.” 
[LINE_0279] 
[LINE_0280] “With me?” He seemed irritated and surprised. But wasn’t it normal for a girl to want to live with 
[LINE_0281] her father? 
[LINE_0282] 
[LINE_0283] She took a step toward him. “I could work in the bookstore. I won’t get in your way.” 
[LINE_0284] 
[LINE_0285] She drew in a sharp breath, waiting. Sound amplified suddenly. She heard people walking, the 
[LINE_0286] platforms groaning beneath them, pigeons flapping their wings overhead, a baby crying. 
[LINE_0287] 
[LINE_0288] Of course, Isabelle. 
[LINE_0289] 
[LINE_0290] Come home. 
[LINE_0291] 
[LINE_0292] Her father sighed in disgust and walked away. 
[LINE_0293] 
[LINE_0294] “Well,” he said, looking back. “Are you coming?” 
[LINE_0295] 
[LINE_0296] * * * 
[LINE_0297] 
[LINE_0298] 
[LINE_0299] 
[LINE_0300] Isabelle lay on a blanket in the sweet-smelling grass, a book open in front of her. Somewhere nearby a 
[LINE_0301] 
[LINE_0302] 
[LINE_0303] 
[LINE_0304] 
[LINE_0305] bee buzzed at a blossom; it sounded like a tiny motorcycle amid all this quiet. It was a blisteringly hot 
[LINE_0306] day, a week after she’d come home to Paris. Well, not home. She knew her father was still plotting to be 
[LINE_0307] rid of her, but she didn’t want to think about that on such a gorgeous day, in the air that smelled of 
[LINE_0308] cherries and sweet, green grass. 
[LINE_0309] 
[LINE_0310] “You read too much,” Christophe said, chewing on a stalk of hay. “What is that, a romantic novel?” 
[LINE_0311] 
[LINE_0312] She rolled toward him, snapping the book shut. It was about Edith Cavell, a nurse in the Great War. 
[LINE_0313] A hero. “I could be a war hero, Christophe.” 
[LINE_0314] 
[LINE_0315] He laughed. “A girl? A hero? Absurd.” 
[LINE_0316] 
[LINE_0317] Isabelle got to her feet quickly, yanking up her hat and white kid gloves. 
[LINE_0318] 
[LINE_0319] “Don’t be mad,” he said, grinning up at her. “I’m just tired of the war talk. And it’s a fact that 
[LINE_0320] women are useless in war. Your job is to wait for our return.” 
[LINE_0321] 
[LINE_0322] He propped his cheek in one hand and peered up at her through the mop of blond hair that fell across 
[LINE_0323] his eyes. In his yachting-style blazer and wide-legged white pants, he looked exactly like what he was — 
[LINE_0324] a privileged university student who was unused to work of any kind. Many students his age had 
[LINE_0325] volunteered to leave university and join the army. Not Christophe. 
[LINE_0326] 
[LINE_0327] Isabelle hiked up the hill and through the orchard, out to the grassy knoll where his open-topped 
[LINE_0328] Panhard was parked. 
[LINE_0329] 
[LINE_0330] She was already behind the wheel, with the engine running, when Christophe appeared, a sheen of 
[LINE_0331] sweat on his conventionally handsome face, the empty picnic basket hanging from his arm. 
[LINE_0332] 
[LINE_0333] “Just throw that stuff in the back,” she said with a bright smile. 
[LINE_0334] 
[LINE_0335] “You’re not driving.” 
[LINE_0336] 
[LINE_0337] “It appears that I am. Now get in.” 
[LINE_0338] 
[LINE_0339] “It’s my automobile, Isabelle.” 
[LINE_0340] 
[LINE_0341] “Well, to be precise — and I know how important the facts are to you, Christophe — it’s your mother’s 
[LINE_0342] automobile. And I believe a woman should drive a woman’s automobile.” 
[LINE_0343] 
[LINE_0344] Isabelle tried not to smile when he rolled his eyes and muttered “fine” and leaned over to place the 
[LINE_0345] basket behind Isabelle’s seat. Then, moving slowly enough to make his point, he walked around the 
[LINE_0346] front of the automobile and took his place in the seat beside her. 
[LINE_0347] 
[LINE_0348] He had no sooner clicked the door shut than she put the automobile in gear and stomped on the gas. 
[LINE_0349] The automobile hesitated for a second, then lurched forward, spewing dust and smoke as it gathered 
[LINE_0350] speed. 
[LINE_0351] 
[LINE_0352] “Mon Dieu, Isabelle. Slow down!” 
[LINE_0353] 
[LINE_0354] She held on to her flapping straw hat with one hand and clutched the steering wheel with the other. 
[LINE_0355] She barely slowed as she passed other motorists. 
[LINE_0356] 
[LINE_0357] “Mon Dieu, slow down,” he said again. 
[LINE_0358] 
[LINE_0359] Certainly he must know that she had no intention of complying. 
[LINE_0360] 
[LINE_0361] “A woman can go to war these days,” Isabelle said when the Paris traffic finally forced her to slow 
[LINE_0362] down. “I could be an ambulance driver, maybe. Or I could work on breaking secret codes. Or charming 
[LINE_0363] 
[LINE_0364] 
[LINE_0365] 
[LINE_0366] 
[LINE_0367] the enemy into telling me a secret location or plan. Remember that game — ” 
[LINE_0368] 
[LINE_0369] “War is not a game, Isabelle.” 
[LINE_0370] 
[LINE_0371] “I believe I know that, Christophe. But if it does come, I can help. That’s all I’m saying.” 
[LINE_0372] 
[LINE_0373] On the rue de l’Amiral de Coligny, she had to slam on the brakes to avoid hitting a lorry. A convoy 
[LINE_0374] from the Comedie Fran^aise was pulling out of the Louvre museum. In fact, there were lorries 
[LINE_0375] everywhere and uniformed gendarmes directing traffic. Sandbags were piled up around several
