[LINE_0001] FIVE 
[LINE_0002] 
[LINE_0003] 
[LINE_0004] 
[LINE_0005] They had been lied to by their government. They’d been assured, time and time again, that the Maginot 
[LINE_0006] Line would keep the Germans out of France. 
[LINE_0007] 
[LINE_0008] Lies. 
[LINE_0009] 
[LINE_0010] Neither concrete and steel nor French soldiers could stop Hitler’s march, and the government had 
[LINE_0011] run from Paris like thieves in the night. It was said they were in Tours, strategizing, but what good did 
[LINE_0012] strategy do when Paris was to be overrun by the enemy? 
[LINE_0013] 
[LINE_0014] “Are you ready?” 
[LINE_0015] 
[LINE_0016] “I am not going, Papa. I have told you this.” She had dressed for travel — as he’d asked — in a red 
[LINE_0017] polka-dot summer dress and low heels. 
[LINE_0018] 
[LINE_0019] “We will not have this conversation again, Isabelle. The Humberts will be here soon to pick you up. 
[LINE_0020] They will take you as far as Tours. From there, I leave it to your ingenuity to get to your sister’s house. 
[LINE_0021] Lord knows you have always been adept at running away.” 
[LINE_0022] 
[LINE_0023] “So you throw me out. Again.” 
[LINE_0024] 
[LINE_0025] “Enough of this, Isabelle. Your sister’s husband is at the front. She is alone with her daughter. You 
[LINE_0026] will do as I say. You will leave Paris.” 
[LINE_0027] 
[LINE_0028] Did he know how this hurt her? Did he care? 
[LINE_0029] 
[LINE_0030] “You’ve never cared about Vianne or me. And she doesn’t want me any more than you do.” 
[LINE_0031] 
[LINE_0032] “You’re going,” he said. 
[LINE_0033] 
[LINE_0034] “I want to stay and fight, Papa. To be like Edith CavFj.” 
[LINE_0035] 
[LINE_0036] He rolled his eyes. “You remember how she died? Executed by the Germans.” 
[LINE_0037] 
[LINE_0038] “Papa, please.” 
[LINE_0039] 
[LINE_0040] “Enough. I have seen what they can do, Isabelle. You have not.” 
[LINE_0041] 
[LINE_0042] “If it’s that bad, you should come with me.” 
[LINE_0043] 
[LINE_0044] “And leave the apartment and bookshop to them?” He grabbed her by the hand and dragged her out 
[LINE_0045] of the apartment and down the stairs, her straw hat and vaF™ banging into the wall, her breath coming 
[LINE_0046] in gasps. 
[LINE_0047] 
[LINE_0048] At last he opened the door and pulled her out onto the Avenue de La Bourdonnais. 
[LINE_0049] 
[LINE_0050] Chaos. Dust. Crowds. The street was a living, breathing dragon of humanity, inching forward, 
[LINE_0051] 
[LINE_0052] 
[LINE_0053] 
[LINE_0054] wheezing dirt, honking horns; people yelling for help, babies crying, and the smell of sweat heavy in the 
[LINE_0055] air. 
[LINE_0056] 
[LINE_0057] Automobiles clogged the area, each burdened beneath boxes and bags. People had taken whatever 
[LINE_0058] they could find — carts and bicycles and even children’s wagons. 
[LINE_0059] 
[LINE_0060] Those who couldn’t find or afford the petrol or an automobile or a bicycle walked. Hundreds — 
[LINE_0061] thousands — of women and children held hands, shuffled forward, carrying as much as they could hold. 
[LINE_0062] Suitcases, picnic baskets, pets. 
[LINE_0063] 
[LINE_0064] Already the very old and very young were falling behind. 
[LINE_0065] 
[LINE_0066] Isabelle didn’t want to join this hopeless, helpless crowd of women and children and old people. 
[LINE_0067] While the young men were away — dying for them at the front — their families were leaving, heading 
[LINE_0068] south or west, although, really, what made any of them think it would be safer there? Hitler’s troops had 
[LINE_0069] already invaded Poland and Belgium and Czechoslovakia. 
[LINE_0070] 
[LINE_0071] The crowd engulfed them. 
[LINE_0072] 
[LINE_0073] A woman ran into Isabelle, mumbled pardon, and kept walking. 
[LINE_0074] 
[LINE_0075] Isabelle followed her father. “I can be useful. Please. I’ll be a nurse or drive an ambulance. I can roll 
[LINE_0076] bandages or even stitch up a wound.” 
[LINE_0077] 
[LINE_0078] Beside them, a horn aah-ooh-gahed. 
[LINE_0079] 
[LINE_0080] Her father looked past her, and she saw the relief that lifted his countenance. Isabelle recognized that 
[LINE_0081] look: it meant he was getting rid of her. Again. “They are here,” he said. 
[LINE_0082] 
[LINE_0083] “Don’t send me away,” she said. “Please.” 
[LINE_0084] 
[LINE_0085] He maneuvp"d her through the crowd to where a dusty black automobile was parked. It had a 
[LINE_0086] saggy, stained mattress strapped to its roof, along with a set of fishing poles and a rabbit cage with the 
[LINE_0087] rabbit still inside. The boot was open but also strapped down; inside she saw a jumble of baskets and 
[LINE_0088] suitcases and lamps. 
[LINE_0089] 
[LINE_0090] Inside the automobile, Monsieur Humbert’s pale, plump fingers clutched the steering wheel as if the 
[LINE_0091] automobile were a horse that might bolt at any second. He was a pudgy man who spent his days in the 
[LINE_0092] butcher shop near Papa’s bookstore. His wife, Patricia, was a sturd^ woman who had the heavy-jowled- 
[LINE_0093] 
[LINE_0094] 
[LINE_0095] 
[LINE_0096] peasant look one saw so often in the country. She was smoking a cigarette and staring out the window 
[LINE_0097] as if she couldn’t believe what she was seeing. 
[LINE_0098] 
[LINE_0099] Monsieur Humbert rolled down his window and poked his face into the opening. “Hello, Julien. She 
[LINE_0100] is ready?” 
[LINE_0101] 
[LINE_0102] Papa nodded. “She is ready. Merci, Edouard.” 
[LINE_0103] 
[LINE_0104] Patricia leaned over to talk to Papa through the open window. “We are only going as far as Orleans. 
[LINE_0105] And she has to pay her share of petrol.” 
[LINE_0106] 
[LINE_0107] “Of course.” 
[LINE_0108] 
[LINE_0109] Isabelle couldn’t leave. It was cowardly. Wrong. “Papa — ” 
[LINE_0110] 
[LINE_0111] “Au revoir,” he said firmly enough to remind her that she had no choice. He nodded toward the car 
[LINE_0112] and she moved numbly toward it. 
[LINE_0113] 
[LINE_0114] 
[LINE_0115] 
[LINE_0116] 
[LINE_0117] She opened the back door and saw three small, dirty girls lying together, eating crackers and 
[LINE_0118] drinking from bottles and playing with dolls. The last thing she wanted was to join them, but she pushed 
[LINE_0119] her way in, made a space for herself among these strangers that smelled vaguely of cheese and sausage, 
[LINE_0120] and closed the door. 
[LINE_0121] 
[LINE_0122] Twisting around in her seat, she stared at her father through the back window. His face held her 
[LINE_0123] gaze; she saw his mouth bend ever so slightly downward; it was the only hint that he saw her. The 
[LINE_0124] crowd surged around him like water around a rock, until all she could see was the wall of bedraggled 
[LINE_0125] strangers coming up behind the car. 
[LINE_0126] 
[LINE_0127] Isabelle faced forward in her seat again. Out her window, a young woman stared back at her, wild 
[LINE_0128] eyes, hair a bird’s nest, an infant suckling on her breast. The car moved slowly, sometimes inching 
[LINE_0129] forward, sometimes stopped for long periods of time. Isabelle watched her countrymen — country women 
[LINE_0130] — shuffle past her, looking dazed and terrified and confused. Every now and then one of them would 
[LINE_0131] pound on the car bonnet or boot, begging for something. They kept the windows rolled up even though 
[LINE_0132] the heat in the car was stifling. 
[LINE_0133] 
[LINE_0134] At first, she was sad to be leaving, and then her anger bloomed, growing hotter even than the air in 
[LINE_0135] the back of this stinking car. She was so tired of being considered disposable. First, her papa had 
[LINE_0136] abandoned her, and then Vianne had pushed her aside. She closed her eyes to hide tears she couldn’t 
[LINE_0137] suppress. In the darkness that smelled of sausage and sweat and smoke, with the children arguing beside 
[LINE_0138] her, she remembered the first time she’d been sent away. 
[LINE_0139] 
[LINE_0140] The long train ride ... Isabelle stuffed in beside Vianne, who did nothing but sniff and cry and 
[LINE_0141] pretend to sleep. 
[LINE_0142] 
[LINE_0143] And then Madame looking down her copper pipe of a nose saying, They will be no trouble. 
[LINE_0144] 
[LINE_0145] Although she’d been young — only four — Isabelle thought she’d learned what alone meant, but she’d 
[LINE_0146] been wrong. In the three years she’d lived at Le Jardin, she’d at least had a sister, even if Vianne was 
[LINE_0147] never around. Isabelle remembered peering down from the upstairs window, watching Vianne and her 
[LINE_0148] friends from a distance, praying to be remembered, to be invited, and then when Vianne had married 
[LINE_0149] Antoine and fired Madame Doom (not her real name, of course, but certainly the tmth), Isabelle had 
[LINE_0150] believed she was a part of the family. But not for long. When Vianne had her miscarriage, it was 
[LINE_0151] instantly good-bye, Isabelle. Three weeks later — at seven — she’d been in her first boarding school. That 
[LINE_0152] was when she really learned about alone. 
[LINE_0153] 
[LINE_0154] “You. Isabelle. Did you bring food?” Patricia asked. She was turned around in her seat, peering at 
[LINE_0155] Isabelle. 
[LINE_0156] 
[LINE_0157] “No.” 
[LINE_0158] 
[LINE_0159] “Wine?” 
[LINE_0160] 
[LINE_0161] “I brought money and clothes and books.” 
[LINE_0162] 
[LINE_0163] “Books,” Patricia said dismissively, and turned back around. “That should help.” 
[LINE_0164] 
[LINE_0165] Isabelle looked out the window again. What other mistakes had she already made? 
[LINE_0166] 
[LINE_0167] 
[LINE_0168] 
[LINE_0169] Hours passed. The automobile made its slow, agonizing way south. Isabelle was grateful for the dust. It 
[LINE_0170] coated the window and obscured the terrible, depressing scene. 
[LINE_0171] 
[LINE_0172] People. Everywhere. In front of them, behind them, beside them; so thick was the crowd that the 
[LINE_0173] automobile could only inch forward in fits and starts. It was like driving through a swarm of bees that 
[LINE_0174] pulled apart for a second and then swarmed again. The sun was punishingly hot. It turned the smelly 
[LINE_0175] automobile interior into an oven and beat down on the women outside who were shuffling toward . . . 
[LINE_0176] what? No one knew what exactly was happening behind them or where safety lay ahead. 
[LINE_0177] 
[LINE_0178] The car lurched forward and stopped hard. Isabelle hit the seat in front of her. The children 
[LINE_0179] immediately started to cry for their mother. 
[LINE_0180] 
[LINE_0181] “Merde, ” Monsieur Humbert muttered. 
[LINE_0182] 
[LINE_0183] “M’sieur Humbert,” Patricia said primly. “The children.” 
[LINE_0184] 
[LINE_0185] An old woman pounded on the car’s bonnet as she shuffled past. 
[LINE_0186] 
[LINE_0187] “That’s it, then, Madame Humbert,” he said. “We are out of petrol.” 
[LINE_0188] 
[LINE_0189] Patricia looked like a landed fish. “What?” 
[LINE_0190] 
[LINE_0191] “I stopped at every chance along the way. You know I did. We have no more petrol and there’s none 
[LINE_0192] to be had.” 
[LINE_0193] 
[LINE_0194] “But . . . well . . . what are we to do?” 
[LINE_0195] 
[LINE_0196] “We’ll find a place to stay. Perhaps I can convince my brother to come fetch us.” Humbert opened 
[LINE_0197] his automobile door, being careful not to hit anyone ambling past, and stepped out onto the dusty, dirt 
[LINE_0198] road. “See. There. Etampes is not far ahead. We’ll get a room and a meal and it will all look better in the 
[LINE_0199] morning.” 
[LINE_0200] 
[LINE_0201] Isabelle sat upright. Surely she had fallen asleep and missed something. Were they going to simply 
[LINE_0202] abandon the automobile? “You think we can walk to Tours?” 
[LINE_0203] 
[LINE_0204] Patricia turned around in her seat. She looked as drained and hot as Isabelle felt. “Perhaps one of 
[LINE_0205] your books can help you. Certainly they were a smarter choice than bread or water. Come, girls. Out of 
[LINE_0206] the automobile.” 
[LINE_0207] 
[LINE_0208] Isabelle reached down for the valise at her feet. It was wedged in tightly and required some effort to 
[LINE_0209] extricate. With a growl of determination, she finally yanked it free and opened the car door and stepped 
[LINE_0210] out. 
[LINE_0211] 
[LINE_0212] She was immediately surrounded by people, pushed and shoved and cursed at. 
[LINE_0213] 
[LINE_0214] Someone tried to yank her suitcase out of her grasp. She fought for it, hung on. As she clutched it to 
[LINE_0215] her body, a woman warned past her, pushing a bicycle laden with possessions. The woman stared at 
[LINE_0216] Isabelle hopelessly, her dark eyes revealing exhaustion. 
[LINE_0217] 
[LINE_0218] Someone else bumped into Isabelle; she stumbled forward and almost fell. Only the thicket of 
[LINE_0219] bodies in front of her saved her from going to her knees in the dust and dirt. She heard the person beside 
[LINE_0220] her apologize, and Isabelle was about to respond when she remembered the Humberts. 
[LINE_0221] 
[LINE_0222] She shoved her way around to the other side of the car, crying out, “M’sieur Humbert!” 
[LINE_0223] 
[LINE_0224] There was no answer, just the ceaseless pounding of feet on the road. 
[LINE_0225] 
[LINE_0226] 
[LINE_0227] 
[LINE_0228] She called out Patricia’s name, but her cry was lost in the thud of so many feet, so many tires 
[LINE_0229] crunching on the dirt. People bumped her, pushed past her. If she fell to her knees, she’d be trampled 
[LINE_0230] and die here, alone in the throng of her countrymen. 
[LINE_0231] 
[LINE_0232] Clutching the smooth leather handle of her valise, she joined the march toward Etampes. 
[LINE_0233] 
[LINE_0234] She was still walking hours later when night fell. Her feet ached; a blister burned with every step. 
[LINE_0235] Hunger walked beside her, poking her insistently with its sharp little elbow, but what could she do about 
[LINE_0236] it? She’d packed for a visit with her sister, not an endless exodus. She had her favorite copy of Madame 
[LINE_0237] Bovary and the book everyone was reading — Autant en emporte le vent — and some clothes; no food or 
[LINE_0238] water. She’d expected that this whole journey would last a few hours. Certainly not that she would be 
[LINE_0239] walking to Carriveau. 
[LINE_0240] 
[LINE_0241] At the top of a small rise, she came to a stop. Moonlight revealed thousands of people walking 
[LINE_0242] beside her, in front of her, behind her; jostling her, bumping into her, shoving her forward until she had 
[LINE_0243] no choice but to stumble along with them. Hundreds more had chosen this hillside as a resting place. 
[LINE_0244] Women and children were camped along the side of the road, in fields and gutters and gullies. 
[LINE_0245] 
[LINE_0246] The dirt road was littered with broken-down automobiles and belongings; forgotten, discarded, 
[LINE_0247] stepped on, too heavy to carry. Women and children lay entangled in the grass or beneath trees or 
[LINE_0248] alongside ditches, asleep, their arms coiled around each other. 
[LINE_0249] 
[LINE_0250] Isabelle came to an exhausted halt on the outskirts of Etampes. The crowd spilled out in front of her, 
[LINE_0251] stumbling onto the road to town. 
[LINE_0252] 
[LINE_0253] And she knew. 
[LINE_0254] 
[LINE_0255] There would be nowhere to stay in Etampes and nothing to eat. The refugees who had arrived before 
[LINE_0256] her would have moved through the town like locusts, buying every foodstuff on the shelves. There 
[LINE_0257] wouldn’t be a room available. Her money would do her no good. 
[LINE_0258] 
[LINE_0259] So what should she do? 
[LINE_0260] 
[LINE_0261] Head southwest, toward Tours and Carriveau. What else? As a girl, she’d studied maps of this 
[LINE_0262] region in her quest to return to Paris. She knew this landscape, if only she could think. 
[LINE_0263] 
[LINE_0264] She peeled away from the crowd headed toward the collection of moonlit gray stone buildings in the 
[LINE_0265] distance and picked her way carefully through the valley. All around her people were seated in the grass 
[LINE_0266] or sleeping beneath blankets. She could hear them moving, whispering. Hundreds of them. Thousands. 
[LINE_0267] On the far side of the field, she found a trail that ran south along a low stone wall. Turning onto it, she 
[LINE_0268] found herself alone. She paused, letting the feel of that settle through her, calm her. Then she began 
[LINE_0269] walking again. After a mile or so the trail led her into a copse of spindly trees. 
[LINE_0270] 
[LINE_0271] She was deep in the woods — trying not to focus on the pain in her toe, the ache in her stomach, the 
[LINE_0272] dryness in her throat — when she smelled smoke. 
[LINE_0273] 
[LINE_0274] And roasting meat. Hunger stripped her resolve and made her careless. She saw the orange glow of 
[LINE_0275] the fire and moved toward it. At the last minute, she realized her danger and stopped. A twig snapped 
[LINE_0276] beneath her foot. 
[LINE_0277] 
[LINE_0278] “You may as well come over,” said a male voice. “You move like an elephant through the woods.” 
[LINE_0279] 
[LINE_0280] 
[LINE_0281] 
[LINE_0282] 
[LINE_0283] Isabelle froze. She knew she’d been stupid. There could be danger here for a girl alone. 
[LINE_0284] 
[LINE_0285] “If I wanted you dead, you’d be dead.” 
[LINE_0286] 
[LINE_0287] That was certainly true. He could have come upon her in the dark and slit her throat. She’d been 
[LINE_0288] paying attention to nothing except the gnawing in her empty stomach and the aroma of roasting meat. 
[LINE_0289] 
[LINE_0290] “You can trust me.” 
[LINE_0291] 
[LINE_0292] She stared into the darkness, trying to make him out. Couldn’t. “You would say that if the opposite 
[LINE_0293] were true, too.” 
[LINE_0294] 
[LINE_0295] A laugh. “Ouz. And now, come here. I have a rabbit on the fire.” 
[LINE_0296] 
[LINE_0297] She followed the glow of firelight over a rocky gully and uphill. The tree trunks around her looked 
[LINE_0298] silver in the moonlight. She moved lightly, ready to run in an instant. At the last tree between her and 
[LINE_0299] the fire she stopped. 
[LINE_0300] 
[LINE_0301] A young man sat by the fire, leaning back against a rough trunk, one leg thrust forward, one bent at 
[LINE_0302] the knee. He was probably only a few years older than Isabelle. 
[LINE_0303] 
[LINE_0304] It was hard to see him well in the orange glow. He had longish, stringy black hair that looked 
[LINE_0305] unfamiliar with a comb or soap and clothes so tattered and patched she was reminded of the war 
[LINE_0306] refugees who’d so recently shuffled through Paris, hoarding cigarettes and bits of paper and empty 
[LINE_0307] bottles, begging for change or help. He had the pale, unwholesome look of someone who never knew 
[LINE_0308] where his next meal was coming from. 
[LINE_0309] 
[LINE_0310] And yet he was offering her food. 
[LINE_0311] 
[LINE_0312] “I hope you are a gentleman,” she said from her place in the darkness. 
[LINE_0313] 
[LINE_0314] He laughed. “I’m sure you do.” 
[LINE_0315] 
[LINE_0316] She stepped into the light cast by the fire. 
[LINE_0317] 
[LINE_0318] “Sit,” he said. 
[LINE_0319] 
[LINE_0320] She sat across from him in the grass. He leaned around the fire and handed her the bottle of wine. 
[LINE_0321] She took a long drink, so long he laughed as she handed him back the bottle and wiped wine from her 
[LINE_0322] chin. 
[LINE_0323] 
[LINE_0324] “What a pretty drunkard you are.” 
[LINE_0325] 
[LINE_0326] She had no idea how to answer that. 
[LINE_0327] 
[LINE_0328] He smiled. 
[LINE_0329] 
[LINE_0330] “Gaetan Dubois. My friends call me Gaet.” 
[LINE_0331] 
[LINE_0332] “Isabelle Rossignol.” 
[LINE_0333] 
[LINE_0334] “Ah, a nightingale.” 
[LINE_0335] 
[LINE_0336] She shrugged. It was hardly a new observation. Her surname meant “nightingale.” Maman had 
[LINE_0337] called Vianne and Isabelle her nightingales as she kissed them good night. It was one of Isabelle’s few 
[LINE_0338] memories of her. “Why are you leaving Paris? A man like you should stay and fight.” 
[LINE_0339] 
[LINE_0340] “They opened the prison. Apparently it is better to have us fight for France than sit behind bars 
[LINE_0341] when the Germans storm through.” 
[LINE_0342] 
[LINE_0343] “You were in prison?” 
[LINE_0344] 
[LINE_0345] 
[LINE_0346] 
[LINE_0347] 
[LINE_0348] “Does that scare you?” 
[LINE_0349] 
[LINE_0350] “No. It’s just ... unexpected.” 
[LINE_0351] 
[LINE_0352] “You should be scared,” he said, pushing the stringy hair out of his eyes. “Anyway, you are safe 
[LINE_0353] enough with me. I have other things on my mind. I am going to check on my maman and sister and then 
[LINE_0354] find a regiment to join. I’ll kill as many of those bastards as I can.” 
[LINE_0355] 
[LINE_0356] “You’re lucky,” she said with a sigh. Why was it so easy for men in the world to do as they wanted 
[LINE_0357] and so difficult for women? 
[LINE_0358] 
[LINE_0359] “Come with me.” 
[LINE_0360] 
[LINE_0361] Isabelle knew better than to believe him. “You only ask because I’m pretty and you think I’ll end up 
[LINE_0362] in your bed if I stay,” she said. 
[LINE_0363] 
[LINE_0364] He stared across the fire at her. It cracked and hissed as fat dripped onto the flames. He took a long 
[LINE_0365] drink of wine and handed the bottle back to her. Near the flames, their hands touched, the barest 
[LINE_0366] brushing of skin on skin. “I could have you in my bed right now if that’s what I wanted.” 
[LINE_0367] 
[LINE_0368] “Not willingly,” she said, swallowing hard, unable to look away. 
[LINE_0369] 
[LINE_0370] “Willingly,” he said in a way that made her skin prickle and made breathing difficult. “But that’s not 
[LINE_0371] what I meant. Or what I said. I asked you to come with me to fight.” 
[LINE_0372] 
[LINE_0373] Isabelle felt something so new she couldn’t quite grasp it. She knew she was beautiful. It was simply 
[LINE_0374] a fact to her. People said it whenever they met her. She saw how men gazed at her with unabashed 
[LINE_0375] desire, remarking on her hair or green eyes or plump lips; how they looked at her breasts. She saw her
