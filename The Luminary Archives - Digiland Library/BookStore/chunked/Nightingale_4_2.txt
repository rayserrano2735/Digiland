[LINE_0376] buildings and monuments to protect from attack — of which there had been none since France joined the 
[LINE_0377] war. 
[LINE_0378] 
[LINE_0379] Why were there so many French policemen out here? 
[LINE_0380] 
[LINE_0381] “Odd,” Isabelle mumbled, frowning. 
[LINE_0382] 
[LINE_0383] Christophe craned his neck to see what was going on. “They’re moving treasures out of the Louvre,” 
[LINE_0384] he said. 
[LINE_0385] 
[LINE_0386] Isabelle saw a break in traffic and sped up. In no time, she had pulled up in front of her father’s 
[LINE_0387] bookshop and parked. 
[LINE_0388] 
[LINE_0389] She waved good-bye to Christophe and ducked into the shop. It was long and narrow, lined from 
[LINE_0390] floor to ceiling with books. Over the years, her father had tried to increase his inventory by building 
[LINE_0391] freestanding bookcases. The result of his “improvements” was the creation of a labyrinth. The stacks led 
[LINE_0392] one this way and that, deeper and deeper within. At the very back were the books for tourists. Some 
[LINE_0393] stacks were well lit, some in shadows. There weren’t enough outlets to illuminate every nook and 
[LINE_0394] cranny. But her father knew every title on every shelf. 
[LINE_0395] 
[LINE_0396] “You’re late,” he said, looking up from his desk in the back. He was doing something with the 
[LINE_0397] printing press, probably making one of his books of poetry, which no one ever purchased. His blunt- 
[LINE_0398] tipped fingers were stained blue. “I suppose boys are more important to you than employment.” 
[LINE_0399] 
[LINE_0400] She slid onto the stool behind the cash register. In the week she’d lived with her father she’d made it 
[LINE_0401] a point not to argue back, although acquiescing gnawed at her. She tapped her foot impatiently. Words, 
[LINE_0402] phrases — excuses — clamored to be spoken aloud. It was hard not to tell him how she felt, but she knew 
[LINE_0403] how badly he wanted her gone, so she held her tongue. 
[LINE_0404] 
[LINE_0405] “Do you hear that?” he said sometime later. 
[LINE_0406] 
[LINE_0407] Had she fallen asleep? 
[LINE_0408] 
[LINE_0409] Isabelle sat up. She hadn’t heard her father approach, but he was beside her now, frowning. 
[LINE_0410] 
[LINE_0411] There was a strange sound in the bookshop, to be sure. Dust fell from the ceiling; the bookcases 
[LINE_0412] clattered slightly, making a sound like chattering teeth. Shadows passed in front of the leaded-glass 
[LINE_0413] display windows at the entrance. Hundreds of them. 
[LINE_0414] 
[LINE_0415] People? So many of them? 
[LINE_0416] 
[LINE_0417] Papa went to the door. Isabelle slid off her stool and followed him. As he opened the door, she saw a 
[LINE_0418] crowd running down the street, filling the sidewalks. 
[LINE_0419] 
[LINE_0420] “What in the world?” Papa muttered. 
[LINE_0421] 
[LINE_0422] Isabelle pushed past Papa, elbowed her way into the crowd. 
[LINE_0423] 
[LINE_0424] 
[LINE_0425] 
[LINE_0426] 
[LINE_0427] A man bumped into her so hard she stumbled, and he didn’t even apologize. More people rushed 
[LINE_0428] past them. 
[LINE_0429] 
[LINE_0430] “What is it? What’s happened?” she asked a florid, wheezing man who was trying to break free of 
[LINE_0431] the crowd. 
[LINE_0432] 
[LINE_0433] “The Germans are coming into Paris,” he said. “We must leave. I was in the Great War. I know. . .” 
[LINE_0434] 
[LINE_0435] Isabelle scoffed. “Germans in Paris? Impossible.” 
[LINE_0436] 
[LINE_0437] He ran away, bobbing from side to side, weaving, his hands fisting and unfisting at his sides. 
[LINE_0438] 
[LINE_0439] “We must get home,” Papa said, locking the bookshop door. 
[LINE_0440] 
[LINE_0441] “It can’t be true,” she said. 
[LINE_0442] 
[LINE_0443] “The worst can always be true,” Papa said grimly. “Stay close to me,” he added, moving into the 
[LINE_0444] crowd. 
[LINE_0445] 
[LINE_0446] Isabelle had never seen such panic. All up and down the street, lights were coming on, automobiles 
[LINE_0447] were starting, doors were slamming shut. People screamed to one another and reached out, trying to stay 
[LINE_0448] connected in the melee. 
[LINE_0449] 
[LINE_0450] Isabelle stayed close to her father. The pandemonium in the streets slowed them down. The Metro 
[LINE_0451] tunnels were too crowded to navigate, so they had to walk all the way. It was nearing nightfall when 
[LINE_0452] they finally made it home. At their apartment building, it took her father two tries to open the main 
[LINE_0453] door, his hands were shaking so badly. Once in, they ignored the rickety cage elevator and hurried up 
[LINE_0454] five flights of stairs to their apartment. 
[LINE_0455] 
[LINE_0456] “Don’t turn on the lights,” her father said harshly as he opened the door. 
[LINE_0457] 
[LINE_0458] Isabelle followed him into the living room and went past him to the window, where she lifted the 
[LINE_0459] blackout shade, peering out. 
[LINE_0460] 
[LINE_0461] From far away came a droning sound. As it grew louder, the window rattled, sounding like ice in a 
[LINE_0462] glass. 
[LINE_0463] 
[LINE_0464] She heard a high whistling sound only seconds before she saw the black flotilla in the sky, like birds 
[LINE_0465] flying in formation. 
[LINE_0466] 
[LINE_0467] Aeroplanes. 
[LINE_0468] 
[LINE_0469] “Bodies,” her father whispered. 
[LINE_0470] 
[LINE_0471] Germans. 
[LINE_0472] 
[LINE_0473] German aeroplanes, flying over Paris. The whistling sound increased, became like a woman’s 
[LINE_0474] scream, and then somewhere — maybe in the second arrondissement, she thought — a bomb exploded in 
[LINE_0475] a flash of eerie bright light, and something caught fire. 
[LINE_0476] 
[LINE_0477] The air raid siren sounded. Her father wrenched the curtains shut and led her out of the apartment 
[LINE_0478] and down the stairs. Their neighbors were all doing the same thing, carrying coats and babies and pets 
[LINE_0479] down the stairs to the lobby and then down the narrow, twisting stone stairs that led to the cellar. In the 
[LINE_0480] dark, they sat together, crowded in close. The air stank of mildew and body odor and fear — that was the 
[LINE_0481] sharpest scent of all. The bombing went on and on and on, screeching and droning, the cellar walls 
[LINE_0482] vibrating around them; dust fell from the ceiling. A baby started crying and couldn’t be soothed. 
[LINE_0483] 
[LINE_0484] 
[LINE_0485] 
[LINE_0486] 
[LINE_0487] “Shut that child up, please,” someone snapped. 
[LINE_0488] 
[LINE_0489] “I am trying, M’sieur. He is scared.” 
[LINE_0490] 
[LINE_0491] “So are we all.” 
[LINE_0492] 
[LINE_0493] After what felt like an eternity, silence fell. It was almost worse than the noise. What of Paris was 
[LINE_0494] left? 
[LINE_0495] 
[LINE_0496] By the time the all clear sounded, Isabelle felt numb. 
[LINE_0497] 
[LINE_0498] “Isabelle?” 
[LINE_0499] 
[LINE_0500] She wanted her father to reach out for her, to take her hand and comfort her, even if it was just for a 
[LINE_0501] moment, but he turned away from her and headed up the dark, twisting basement stairs. In their 
[LINE_0502] apartment, Isabelle went immediately to the window, peering past the shade to look for the Eiffel Tower. 
[LINE_0503] It was still there, rising above a wall of thick black smoke. 
[LINE_0504] 
[LINE_0505] “Don’t stand by the windows,” he said. 
[LINE_0506] 
[LINE_0507] She turned slowly. The only light in the room was from his torch, a sickly yellow thread in the dark. 
[LINE_0508] “Paris won’t fall,” she said. 
[LINE_0509] 
[LINE_0510] He said nothing. Frowned. She wondered if he was thinking of the Great War and what he’d seen in 
[LINE_0511] the trenches. Perhaps his injury was hurting again, aching in sympathy with the sound of falling bombs 
[LINE_0512] and hissing flames. 
[LINE_0513] 
[LINE_0514] “Go to bed, Isabelle.” 
[LINE_0515] 
[LINE_0516] “How can I possibly sleep at a time like this?” 
[LINE_0517] 
[LINE_0518] He sighed. “You will learn that a lot of things are possible.”
