As Salsa gains popularity outside the Latin world and across generations, more non-Spanish-speaking fans are seeking translations of lyrics to connect with the music. Doing this can be challenging. Let’s translate Tupac’s rap into Spanish, and we’ll see that it’s not simple. However, we want the genre to keep expanding, so we can’t ignore a development that’s actually very positive. One idea I often consider is finding a way to start creating Salsa songs in English. Some have attempted this, but it hasn’t gained widespread traction yet. Maybe that’s a more authentic innovation than translating works that carry such a heavy cultural context, which would also need translation. Before long, you’re basically in “translating a joke” territory. The rhythm wouldn’t require adjustments, but I believe we need English-language Salsa songs that stand on their own, addressing American culture directly without translation. It sounds like a good idea, but it hasn’t come to fruition for a reason. We should keep exploring ways to do it. The English-speaking market is incredibly important.
