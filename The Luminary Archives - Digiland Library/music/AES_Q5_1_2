I’ve had a deep passion for Salsa for as long as I can remember. I recall singing “Soy Feliz” along with Ismael Rivera when I was a little kid, and how that song made me feel strange sensations I had never experienced before, almost like entering a different dimension. The natural progression was to El Gran Combo, and Salsa has been my main focus ever since. Regarding Salsa structure, I believe the conga and the piano form its backbone. Of course, every element is essential, and one instrument that is often missing but really influences everything is the clave. I remember during recording and mixing sessions always requesting that the piano and conga never be overshadowed by other instruments. Some of my influences include Marc Anthony and Gilberto Santa Rosa, among many others.
In my style, I try to blend a deep ballad-type song with meaningful lyrics for half of the recording, then switch to heavy rhythms for the second half, where the instrumentals and choruses provide a great aerobic workout. That combination feels modern to me, since you usually get one or the other. I also added a cello, which isn't very common in Salsa, because I believe its sound is so powerful, and just one cello, with a single note, can stand beside all the brass section. It’s incredible how much sound one string can produce. Plus, nobody expresses sorrow like Mr. Cello. I think music styles, Salsa included, must keep evolving or risk becoming outdated. Salsa is making a strong comeback, with a Salsa-based song reaching number one in the USA for the first time recently (Bad Bunny’s DTMF), showing how evolution keeps us relevant in the present.
