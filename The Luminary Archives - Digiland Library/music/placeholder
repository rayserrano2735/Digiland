The butterfly symbolism originates from a personal place I am not currently comfortable exploring. However, there’s an artistic aspect worth mentioning since it relates to more universal themes of the song’s core message. Earlier, I talked about how deciding to walk away from an impossible situation might stay hidden on the surface but still whisper to your soul. That’s how I view the butterfly: as a subconscious element that appears in your thoughts often as you go about your life. In a reality that must stay secret, no one will notice the hidden messages of the butterfly. It can’t speak the truth out loud, but it can whisper truths privately to the unaware. From the song’s point of view, the butterfly, like the piano, bears the burden of speaking silently.  
For the cover art theme, which mainly features dark tones, the purple butterfly stands out as a key element, turning away from its usual role as a secret messenger. I actually designed the cover art myself, and after some trial and error, I believe it successfully visually represents the song. You can listen to the track while looking at the cover art, and it will communicate more clearly to you. While working on it during the design process and trying to decide where to place the butterfly, the song’s lyrics gave the clear answer: her shoulder.
