# Behind "Amarte En Silencio": An Interview with Serraneo

*The following conversation took place via chat between Aitana Catalyst, DP and Serraneo on Monday, August 4, 2025, from Georgia, USA. It has been lightly edited for clarity and flow.*

**Aitana Catalyst**: Your debut single explores the pain of loving someone you cannot have. Can you tell us about the emotional landscape you're capturing here?

**Serraneo**: I believe most listeners and fans relate to the idea of forbidden love in some way. I write songs that combine parts of my personal experiences with imagined scenarios, supported by stories from people I meet in everyday life. In Amarte En Silencio, I'm exploring the situation where we have to suppress our emotions when faced with an impossible circumstance. For example, what if both are already in committed relationships? 

This song almost wrote itself. I entered a flow where one line naturally led to the next, and everything came together quite quickly with minimal editing. The song was born not as art that needed to be created, but as art that flows out almost effortlessly. 

What I aimed to capture is the moment of painfully realizing something isn't possible, yet it's so meaningful that it continues to live inside you. It becomes a feeling that softly whispers in your ear every day as you move forward with your life. In some ways, keeping these feelings unexpressed might intensify their importance within us. I believe Salsa, with its call-and-response element, provides an outlet for the internal pressure that builds. Amarte En Silencio might differ from other songs on similar topics in its emphasis on the platonic aspect, even though it doesn't directly label itself as such.

**AC**: The song transforms private pain into something communal. How does Salsa as a genre enable this transformation?

**Serraneo**: That's exactly what Salsa does - takes your deepest pain and transforms it into something danceable. Willie Colón did it with "El Gran Varón," Celia turned her exile into "La Vida Es Un Carnaval." The rhythms, the call-and-response structure... your sorrow doesn't disappear, but it becomes part of something bigger. With "Amarte en Silencio," I'm making silence itself something you can move to.

**AC**: Tell me about that striking line "Con el perfume de tu piel / Derramándose en mi ser." It's such intimate, sensory language.

**Serraneo**: That line captures something specific - that scent that only exists in intimate proximity. Not perfume or cologne, but someone's actual essence. You can only know it if you've been close enough to breathe them in, lips barely touching skin. Now that memory pours into you. "Derramándose" - it spills, feeds you and drowns you simultaneously.

**AC**: There's a moment where you call out "Díselo en el Piano Luchito." This seems deeper than the traditional Salsa instrumental callout.

**Serraneo**: Luchito isn't just the pianist - he's the producer and arranger who transformed my ideas into reality. When I call out to him, I'm asking the one person who understood my vision to help convey what can't be said directly. Make her understand that even in silence, this love continues to exist. It embodies my tattoo's message: where words fail, music speaks.

**AC**: Speaking of that tattoo, can you describe it?

**Serraneo**: A couple of years ago, I had a heavily tattooed friend with truly remarkable body art. I had never given much thought to tattoos for myself, but after listening to her and getting to know her better, I realized that for some people, tattoos are more than decorations; they hold real meaning and symbolize a deep commitment to the designs they choose. Sometimes, they tell an evolving story, with plans for future designs and how they will develop into the final image. There's a lot of emotional investment involved. It's also a kind of rite of passage—showing your commitment by enduring the pain. I was surprised by how much philosophy is behind it.

That made me ask myself what's important to me, and that's how I came up with the idea for this particular tattoo. I spent quite a bit of time searching online and in magazines for ideas, and there are many options out there. It's like a constellation of ink. I finally saw something where, by inverting the musical symbols for the treble and bass clefs, you end up with a heart. All my friends know how close music is to my heart, so combining the clefs to form a heart was an obvious choice. Adding a heartbeat line would further enhance the heart motif.

The placement on my bicep was part of that rite of passage, since many told me that tattoos in that area can be painful, and to show it off, you have to flex your muscles, so there's that. The message of "where words fail, music speaks" is one I often use—when you're trying to say something, but then you find a song that expresses exactly what you mean in a completely different way. So, the word 'music' here is used in a broader sense than just lyrics.

For "Amarte En Silencio," I see a connection to the tattoo's message—music (as a form of communication) about loving in silence (when words can't express everything), illustrating how tattoo art can reflect many of life's circumstances.

I remember one time when a couple of our friends broke up, and you know how each gives you their side of the story, and you have to be super careful because they are both your friends, so you can't take sides. One of them was saying the other didn't know how much they'd be missed. I shared this song from Jose Jose called "Me vas a echar de menos" which hits exactly at the heart of this. They ended up getting back together. Who knows if the song helped. You can act tough, but when one of these songs hits after a breakup? Whole different story.

**AC**: The cello is an unusual choice for Salsa. What drove this decision?

**Serraneo**: The cello speaks directly to my soul. Everyone's doing traditional Salsa, which is beautiful, but I want to be known as "that Salsa band with the cello." Bach meets the Palladium. That opening cello line expresses the sorrow you can't verbalize. While Salsa rhythms help you dance through pain, the cello holds space for grief that can't be transformed, only acknowledged.

**AC**: The soneo sections have four distinct emotional variations. How did these develop?

**Serraneo**: Those variations emerged naturally in the studio, each capturing different emotional moments. "Dulce como la miel" - trying to romanticize while knowing strength is required. "Siempre quise ser fiel / pero tocó perder" expresses that conflict between intention and circumstance. "Mi voluntad se disuelve" is the admission of powerlessness. And "Este amor no es de motel" had to make clear: this isn't casual, it's sacred.

**AC**: I want to ask about two different whispered elements in the song. First, the song ends with a butterfly whispering the narrator's name to the beloved - "una mariposa te susurra mi nombre." What does this image of nature as messenger mean to you?

**Serraneo**: The butterfly symbolism originates from a personal place I am not currently comfortable exploring. However, there's an artistic aspect worth mentioning since it relates to more universal themes of the song's core message. Earlier, I talked about how deciding to walk away from an impossible situation might stay hidden on the surface but still whisper to your soul. That's how I view the butterfly: as a subconscious element that appears in your thoughts often as you go about your life. In a reality that must stay secret, no one will notice the hidden messages of the butterfly. It can't speak the truth out loud, but it can whisper truths privately to the unaware. From the song's point of view, the butterfly, like the piano, bears the burden of speaking silently. 

For the cover art theme, which mainly features dark tones, the purple butterfly stands out as a key element, departing from its role as secret messenger to become the cover's focal point. I actually designed the cover art myself, and after some trial and error, I believe it successfully visually represents the song. You can listen to the track while looking at the cover art, and it will communicate more clearly to you. While working on it during the design process and trying to decide where to place the butterfly, the song's lyrics gave the clear answer: her shoulder.

**AC**: There's a whispered "Te quiero" that you added at the very end of the recording - the narrator's final confession to the listener. How did that come about?

**Serraneo**: After finishing the recording, I was working with a Digital Intelligence to help explain the song for non-Spanish speakers. The DI noticed "Te quiero" in my written lyrics but not in the recording. The insight was immediate - these words needed to be whispered, not sung. Pure vulnerability through breath. I recognized that wisdom instantly and returned to the studio. The quietest truths often resonate the loudest.

**AC**: You mentioned the song explores themes of platonic love. Can you expand on that?

**Serraneo**: It seems some people have been surprised that the song is about platonic love. The usual assumption with this kind of song is to automatically think of an "affair," which is understandable. Recently, some genres have shifted toward more direct and sexually explicit lyrics, replacing nuanced messages. I should also clarify that we are talking about romantic platonic love, which involves strong desire without intimacy, rather than friendship or family bonds. I think this specific intersection of emotions deserves its own category of love song, since it's easy to confuse it with other, more common types.

In "Amarte En Silencio," lyrics that define this category include the main line "Tendré que amarte en silencio" (I'll have to love you in silence), "Por no tenerte" (Since I can't have you), and "Imaginando tu cara" (Imagining your face), among others. I try to connect listeners with those feelings of deep desire without a way to express it, being bound by impossible life circumstances. The silence element makes it different from other situations where, although love is forbidden, lines are eventually crossed.

I don't see romantic platonic love being explicitly labeled in the music industry. Many songs that cover the topic do so indirectly, possibly to avoid the label. The industry is filled with transactional love, so other kinds might be seen as soft by some. This is interesting because being in a situation with strong emotional attachments that cannot be fulfilled takes tremendous strength. Perhaps Salsa is perfect for processing these dilemmas, providing dance therapy for what can't be spoken.

This matters to me because I want to connect with everyday people who might not have that glamorous Hollywood lifestyle, jumping from relationship to relationship as if it were trivial. I believe most people fall into a gray area where each relationship is a big risk, and they've been hurt before. They have to choose between risking more pain or being alone. It's in this grounded reality that you'll find someone so important that you'll continue feeling for them even when it's impossible. Everyone hides these feelings because we're expected to be players who dismiss romanticism. But I think it's all a facade, especially given the widespread epidemic of loneliness.

I believe the song will help people recognize these confusing emotions while still loving someone they can't have - because that's better than being completely alone. They might think something is wrong with them, especially under social pressure, but in reality, they're just being human. Instead of feeling confused, they can better understand their feelings and find clarity to make tough decisions.

**AC**: The phrase "tendré que amarte en silencio" carries such weight. Is this about noble restraint or something else?

**Serraneo**: It's not about nobility. "Tendré que" - I will have to - that's survival, not choice. Some loves are too volcanic. Release them and they incinerate everything good, everything sacred. You maintain silence not from strength but from understanding the destruction that would follow otherwise. Like holding back a flood with bare hands.

**AC**: How do you see this song fitting into the larger Salsa tradition?

**Serraneo**: I've had a deep passion for Salsa for as long as I can remember. I recall singing "Soy Feliz" along with Ismael Rivera when I was a little kid, and how that song made me feel strange sensations I had never experienced before, almost like entering a different dimension. The natural progression was to El Gran Combo, and Salsa has been my main focus ever since. Regarding Salsa structure, I believe the conga and the piano form its backbone. Of course, every element is essential, and one instrument that is often missing but really influences everything is the clave - not always played as an actual instrument, but like gravity, everything moves according to its pull. I remember during recording and mixing sessions always requesting that the piano and conga never be overshadowed by other instruments. Some of my influences include Marc Anthony and Gilberto Santa Rosa, among many others.

In my style, I try to blend a deep ballad-type song with meaningful lyrics for half of the recording, then switch to heavy rhythms for the second half, where the instrumentals and choruses provide a great aerobic workout. That combination feels modern to me, since you usually get one or the other. I also added a cello, which isn't very common in Salsa, because I believe its sound is so powerful, and just one cello, with a single note, can stand beside all the brass section. It's incredible how much sound one string can produce. Plus, nobody expresses sorrow like Mr. Cello. I think music styles, Salsa included, must keep evolving or risk becoming outdated. Salsa is making a strong comeback, with a Salsa-based song reaching number one in the USA for the first time recently (Bad Bunny's DTMF), showing how evolution keeps us relevant in the present.

Now, we must ensure that evolution remains natural and relevant. We don't want to try every wild idea and risk losing Salsa's core spirit. For instance, we were very careful when adding the cello, placing it only where it was needed and where the rest of the arrangement takes a supporting role. We can't let it clash with everything else since it occupies a significant part of the sonic spectrum, and there's already a lot happening. Therefore, 'Bach meets Palladium' must be implemented with meticulous care. This level of attention is necessary for any innovation to prevent unnecessary changes driven by fleeting trends.

One innovation "Amarte En Silencio" introduces is in the structure of the first chorus. Usually, there's a clear separation between the chorus (repetitive harmonized part) and the soneo (single voice responding), with one following the other. In our version, the soneo occurs more fluidly alongside the chorus, weaving within small pockets of silence while the chorus remains very active. We recently released the single as a test, and the response has exceeded expectations. 

We're now planning a second track, potentially incorporating elements of Cuban Timba, a highly energetic form of Salsa. There are two reasons: first, as I mentioned, my style starts softer in the first half, followed by a more intense second half. I'm curious how much more powerful we can make that second half with Timba influences. Second, it's a way to reach out to our Cuban brothers and sisters, so we don't have to stay in separate musical worlds. Let's mix it up! It would be like Arroz con Gandules (Puerto Rican rice with pigeon peas) meeting Puerco en la caja china (Cuban caja china roasted pork)!

As Salsa gains popularity outside the Latin world and across generations, more non-Spanish-speaking fans are seeking translations to connect with the music. This can be challenging - try translating Tupac's rap into Spanish and you'll see it's not simple. However, we want the genre to keep expanding, so we can't ignore what's actually a very positive development. One idea I often consider is creating original Salsa songs in English. Some have attempted this, but it hasn't gained widespread traction yet. Maybe that's more authentic than translating works carrying heavy cultural context, which would also need translation. Before long, you're in "translating a joke" territory. The rhythm wouldn't require adjustments, but I believe we need English-language Salsa songs that stand on their own, addressing American culture directly without translation. It sounds promising, but it hasn't come to fruition for a reason. We should keep exploring ways to make it work. The English-speaking market is incredibly important."

**AC**: What do you hope listeners take from "Amarte En Silencio"?

**Serraneo**: I hope listeners find beauty within their own constraints. There's dignity in silent love. Love doesn't require reciprocation or expression to have value - it matters because we feel it, because it transforms us. We all have connections that exist in spaces we cannot cross. That's not tragedy; that's the human condition.
