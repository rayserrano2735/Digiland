I donâ€™t see romantic or platonic love being explicitly labeled in the music industry, since I think many songs that really cover the topic do so indirectly, possibly to avoid the label. The industry is filled with many different types of transactional love, so other kinds might be seen as soft by some. This is interesting because I would say that being in a situation with strong emotional attachments that cannot be fulfilled takes a lot of strength. Perhaps salsa is a good way to process these dilemmas, providing dance therapy.
