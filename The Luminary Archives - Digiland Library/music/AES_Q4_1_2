It seems some people have been surprised that the song is about platonic love. The usual assumption with this kind of song is to automatically think of an "affair," which is understandable. Recently, some genres have shifted toward more direct and sexually explicit lyrics, replacing nuanced messages. I should also clarify that we are talking about romantic platonic love, which involves a strong desire without intimacy, rather than friendship or family bonds known as platonic love. I think this specific intersection of emotions probably deserves its own category of love song, since it is easy to confuse it with other, more common types of love songs. 
In Amarte En Silencio, some lyrics that define it in this category include the main line “I’ll have to love you in silence,” “Since I can’t have you,” and “Imagining your face,” among others. I try to connect listeners with those feelings of deep desire without a way to express it, being bound by impossible life circumstances. The silence element makes it different from other situations where, although the love is forbidden, lines are crossed.
