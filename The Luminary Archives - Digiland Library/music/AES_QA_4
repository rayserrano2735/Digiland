This relationship area matters to me because I want to connect with everyday people who might not have that glamorous lifestyle Hollywood promotes, jumping from relationship to relationship as if it were trivial. I believe most people fall into a gray area, where each relationship is a big risk, and they’ve been hurt before. They have to choose between risking more pain or being alone. It's in this more grounded group that you’ll find someone so important to you that you’ll continue feeling emotions even when it's impossible. Everybody hides these feelings because we are all expected to be players who dismiss romanticism. But I think it’s all a facade, especially given the widespread epidemic of loneliness.
