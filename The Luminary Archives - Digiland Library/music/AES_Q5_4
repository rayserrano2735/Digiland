One other innovation Amarte En Silencio introduces is in the structure of the first chorus. Usually, you have a chorus structure where the separation between the chorus (repetitive harmonized part) and the soneo (single voice responding to the chorus without repeating) is clear, with one coming after the other. In our version, the soneo occurs more fluidly alongside the chorus, weaving within small pockets of silence since the chorus is very active. We recently released the single as a test, and the response has exceeded expectations. We are now planning to release a second track, potentially incorporating elements of Cuban Timba, a highly energetic form of Salsa. There are two reasons for this: first, as I mentioned, my style starts with a softer first half, followed by a more intense second half. I’m curious how much more powerful we can make that second half with some Timba influences. Second, it’s also a way to reach out to our Cuban brothers and sisters, so we don’t have to stay in separate musical worlds. Let’s mix it up! It would be like “Arroz con Gandules” and “Puerco en la caja china!”
